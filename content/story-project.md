A big thank-you to everyone who had a hand in putting together We Are the Clay, the book of stories that resulted from our year of work on the Story Project. If you did not preorder the book at church but wish to buy a copy, you can now purchase it on Amazon (with free shipping if you are an Amazon Prime member). The cost of the book is $15, and all proceeds go to First Baptist Church.

If you have any questions, see Julie Davis or any member of the Story Project Team.
