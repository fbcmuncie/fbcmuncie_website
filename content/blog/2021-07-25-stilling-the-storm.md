Stilling the Storm

If you study your Bible carefully, you will discover the place where Jesus did most of his teaching and preaching and healing was around the Sea of Galilee. When the disciples found themselves in the middle of a storm, Jesus wondered, “Why are you so afraid?” Do you still have no faith?

That day when evening came, he said to his disciples, “Let us go over to the other side.” Leaving the crowd behind, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats with him. A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat so that it was nearly swamped. Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. The disciples woke him and said to him, “Teacher, don’t you care if we drown?”

He got up, rebuked the wind, and said to the waves, “Quiet! Be still!” Then the wind died down, and it was completely calm.

He said to his disciples, “Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?”

They were terrified and asked each other, “Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!”

-Mark 4:35-41, NIV

Sometimes people think Jesus doesn’t care, yet he does! The capacity of Jesus to bring calm and peace to our lives is often underestimated. How does one have access to such peace? Jesus is not asleep. What is your condition when the storms of life come to you? Afraid, calm, peaceful, panicked? God has answers you and I need to put into practice.
