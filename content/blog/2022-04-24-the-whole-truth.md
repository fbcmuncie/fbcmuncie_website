The Whole Truth |  Acts 5:1-11

The Bible tells it like it is. It is an honest book and describes reality as it is. Luke says there was a man in the early church named Ananias, who had a wife named Saphira. This passage of Scripture tells their story and how they reacted in their community of faith when it was expected one should give their best to Christ and the Church. The story reveals the temptations of distorting the truth while making up your own rules. Did they have an excuse or an explanation? 

Then Peter said, “Ananias, how is it that Satan has so filled your heart that you have lied to the Holy Spirit and have kept for yourself some of the money you received for the land? Didn’t it belong to you before it was sold? And after it was sold, wasn’t the money at your disposal? What made you think of doing such a thing? You have not lied just to human beings but to God.”

-Acts 5:3-4, NIV

Let us learn together how we can avoid what Ananias and Sapphira did to themselves.
