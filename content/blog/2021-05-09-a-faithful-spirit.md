A Faithful Spirit

As we think of ourselves through the generations, we consider our past, present, and future. Is it true that one generation affects another? Does training and nurturing affect the inherited genes that flow down to us?

Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, in keeping with the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus, To Timothy, my dear son:

Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. 

I thank God, whom I serve, as my ancestors did, with a clear conscience, as night and day I constantly remember you in my prayers. Recalling your tears, I long to see you, so that I may be filled with joy. I am reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, now lives in you also.

For this reason, I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands. For the Spirit God gave us does not make us timid, but gives us power, love and self-discipline.

2 Timothy 1:1-7, NIV

The power of God in Christ Jesus can make a difference as we are responsible to God who changes us, molds us, and shapes us into His image.

Join us as we celebrate Motherâ€™s Day and thank God for His faithful Spirit, who seeks to lead us into His future.
