Have you or someone that is close to you experienced the pain of divorce? If the statistics are correct, marriages survive at a rate of around 60 percent. Divorce is sometimes a contentious issue in the church. We sometimes wonder if there are times when God permits divorce. This week, we come to Jesus' section on divorce in the Sermon on the Mount. I will do my best to address this difficult issue. 

Let me invite you to read passage ahead of time and pray for God to speak to us through his Word as we study it together. 

This week's scripture is Matthew 5:31-32.

>(Matthew 5:31-32 NTE) "It was also said, 'If someone divorces his wife, he should give her a legal document to prove it.'  But I say to you: everyone who divorces his wife, unless it's in connection with immorality, makes her commit adultery; and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
