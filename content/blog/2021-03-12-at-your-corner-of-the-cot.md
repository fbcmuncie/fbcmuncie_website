How much of the Gospel do we have within ourselves? God intends for you to see Him; to respond to Him in a tone, a spirit, an attitude with vision and purpose, with an enhanced perception of His desire to live inside of you. How much of the Holy Spirit are you going to receive into your life today? 

Know yourself. Know your setting. Know the Spirit. Find your Corner.

As we ready our hearts for this Sunday’s message, let's meditate on Luke 5:17-25 and consider how the Lord can uniquely use us in the world. 
One day Jesus was teaching, and Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there. They had come from every village of Galilee and from Judea and Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was with Jesus to heal the sick. Some men came carrying a paralyzed man on a mat and tried to take him into the house to lay him before Jesus. When they could not find a way to do this because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him on his mat through the tiles into the middle of the crowd, right in front of Jesus.

When Jesus saw their faith, he said, “Friend, your sins are forgiven.”

The Pharisees and the teachers of the law began thinking to themselves, “Who is this fellow who speaks blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but God alone?”

Jesus knew what they were thinking and asked, “Why are you thinking these things in your hearts? Which is easier: to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’? But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.” So he said to the paralyzed man, “I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home.” Immediately he stood up in front of them, took what he had been lying on and went home praising God.
