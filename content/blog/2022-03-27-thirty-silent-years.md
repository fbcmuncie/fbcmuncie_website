Thirty Silent Years | Luke 2:40-52

God so loved the world that He sent Jesus. How did Jesus grow up to become the identified Son of God? How do our children grow up, and what can a church do to assure their Christian education? This is no time for the church to be silent, so what do we say and what do we do to help children and youth in today’s world? 

Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. But his mother treasured all these things in her heart. And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.

Luke 2:51-52, NIV

Come and join us as we seek to allow God’s Spirit to lead us to truth and vision for the future.
