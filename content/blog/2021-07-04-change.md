Change

Why can’t things be like they used to be? Change is tough. Whatever it is, most people simply don’t like a lot of change. This holiday weekend, we will explore the realities of change and the principles of change Jesus taught us. 

As they were going along the road, someone said to him, “I will follow you wherever you go.” And Jesus said to him, “Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.” To another he said, “Follow me.” But he said, “Lord, let me first go and bury my father.”  And Jesus said to him, “Leave the dead to bury their own dead. But as for you, go and proclaim the kingdom of God.” Yet another said, “I will follow you, Lord, but let me first say farewell to those at my home.” Jesus said to him, “No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.”

Luke 9:57-62, ESV

Jesus did not disregard the past, but if you follow Jesus, He reminds us that he is always out in front of us, calling us toward faith and the “newness” of life available to each of us who will trust Him.
