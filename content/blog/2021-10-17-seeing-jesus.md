Seeing Jesus | John 20:10-18

One can never change the nature of God, but the nature of a man or woman can be changed. We can change if we want to, and some of us have to begin by opening our eyes and seeing Jesus. All progress in humanity has been because of change. As we go about doing ministry and missions, one of the things we must lose is the idea that God is always going to rescue us. He doesn’t always do that. So how do you view Jesus when that happens to you?

Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news: “I have seen the Lord!” And she told them that he had said these things to her.
John 20:18, NIV

Faith in the real world is one that has been transformed through the power of Christ’s Spirit. It is a life that has been hammered out on the anvil of life situations and not kept protected in a sterile environment. As we worship together and study this passage, “seeing Jesus” is not only possible, but it is exactly what needs to happen to all of us!
