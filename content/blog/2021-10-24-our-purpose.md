Our Purpose | Genesis 6:5-9

Sometimes a “fresh start” is needed. So where does one begin?

God’s purpose for a “re-freshed” creation calls for a “re-freshed” YOU! God wants us to take his purpose with an uncompromising seriousness. There is a plan for how we are to relate to each other. There’s a plan for the kind of people God wants us to be.

"So the Lord said, 'I will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created—and with them the animals, the birds and the creatures that move along the ground—for I regret that I have made them.' But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord."

Genesis 6:7-8, NIV

What are we doing with His world? What are we doing with each other? What are we doing to ourselves? This message will challenge all of us to think about how God’s heart is seeking to move us closer to him and his original purpose for our lives.
