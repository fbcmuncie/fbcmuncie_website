Thomas the Disciple

“Doubting Thomas” was his nickname, but in reality, he gave words of confession that all of us need to remember – “My Lord and my God.” The Gospel of John was written so we could discover how such a conclusion could be reached as Jesus offered himself to Thomas.

 Although the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you.” Then he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here, and see my hands; and put out your hand, and place it in my side. Do not disbelieve, but believe.” Thomas answered him, “My Lord and my God!”

John 20:26b-28, ESV

The life of Thomas and his story will yield benefits for all who dare to come and learn how he moved from doubt to faith.
