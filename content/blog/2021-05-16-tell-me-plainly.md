Tell Me Plainly

Sometimes one feels as if there can be a small group among us who try to keep us in the dark. How do you express your faith in ways so others may understand clearly what it means to follow God and His teachings? 

Then came the Festival of Dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter, and Jesus was in the temple courts walking in Solomon’s Colonnade. The Jews who were there gathered around him, saying, “How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly.” 

Jesus answered, “I did tell you, but you do not believe. The works I do in my Father’s name testify about me, but you do not believe because you are not my sheep. My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand. I and the Father are one.” 

Again his Jewish opponents picked up stones to stone him,

John 10:22-31, NIV

Tell me plainly – What does it mean to follow Jesus? What does it mean to be saved? How do we explain our faith? Come and discover God’s truth clearly and plainly.
