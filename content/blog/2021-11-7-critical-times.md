Critical Times | Luke 22:39-43

The cross is a focus for Christians to find and follow God’s plan for one’s life. One cannot move in life according to our will and plan and purpose, and then come to an hour of emergency, backs against the wall, boxed into a corner, and then feebly cry out to God.

“Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done.” An angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him.

Luke 22:42-43, NIV

The resources of heaven come to us when we yield our lives to his care and keeping.  James 2:17 reminds us: “Faith, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.”
