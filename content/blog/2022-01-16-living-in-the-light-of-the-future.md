Living in the Light of the Future | Philippians 3:7-11

The Apostle Paul gives us insight into how we should look at life. It is described as profit and loss in Paul's words, but more importantly, it causes us to measure ourselves in the light of Jesus Christ and the presence of His powerful Spirit, who is seeking to teach us more about Him today. What is necessary to become a child of God? How does one practice the Christian life with a new identity? 

What is more, I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them garbage, that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christâ€”the righteousness that comes from God on the basis of faith.

-Philippians 3:8-9, NIV

Faith in Jesus Christ matters, and this message will assist all of us in knowing Christ better. Be present for worship, practice worship daily, and expect God's Spirit to guide you into the future.
