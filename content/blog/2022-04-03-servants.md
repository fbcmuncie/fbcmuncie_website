Servants |  Matthew 23:1-12

Several years ago, I read a book about doing church in the 21st century. The author discussed several ingredients of what he called a “high commitment congregation.” Some of his observations included: church leadership who had a strong commitment toward excellence; the focus of ministry was always on people; the leadership had high expectations of its membership, and the church perceived itself as being on a journey toward unreserved discipleship.

The greatest among you will be your servant. For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.

Matthew 23:11-12, NIV

What was the role of Jesus and His servant spirit that he attempted to make a reality for the disciples and his followers? What kind of character does a follower of Jesus have? How should Christians relate to others who are outside the Church? What does it mean to be a witness? Come and worship and let’s discover together Jesus’ plan for the future.
