The participation in our Resurrection Sunday live stream was wonderful. While we don't know the exact number, we had many of our families worshiping together. It was a wonderful experience. 

This Sunday continues the season of Easter. We begin a series in which we talk about how Jesus' followers live in light of His Resurrection. We venture back to Jesus' hillside teaching in Matthew 5-7. We are going to be in these chapters for the next few months, moving slowly. If you have spent time in the Sermon on the Mount, you know these are difficult verses. They challenge our ability to *follow the rules*, the expectations of our Creator. Join us on Sunday as we explore *how* to read this vital passage. We will look at common misconceptions of these verses and prepare for a series that will take us deep into this famous sermon.

We will provide a sermon video and music videos for you to gather with your family for worship. Children lessons will also be provided as usual. We continue to look forward to being together again in person, but encourage you to take the time to worship in this manner. 


>(Matthew 5:1-2 NIV) Now when he saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down. His disciples came to him, and he began to teach them saying: 


>(Matthew 7:28-29 NIV) When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching, because he taught as one who had authority, and not as their teachers of the law.
