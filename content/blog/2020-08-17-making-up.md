It has been wonderful working through Philippians with you for the past several weeks. This week, we move into the final chapter. We are going to take it slow as we finish this series. This week, we will only cover the first three verses of the chapter. 

We learn in these verses how Paul views the church in Philippi. He loves them deeply and longs to see them. At the same time, we learn of a conflict in the church. Paul urges two women in the church to reconcile with one another. It fascinating to peek into first century church life. We can learn much from the dynamics that are taking place here. I hope you will join us on Sunday as we study these verses together. I will include them below in the New Testament for Everyone translation. Please take the time to read them before coming to worship on Sunday.

> (Philippians 4:1-3 NTE)  Well then, my dear family – I miss you so much, you're my joy and crown! – this is how you must stand firm in the Lord, my beloved people.  I have a special appeal which goes jointly to Euodia and Syntyche: please, please, come to a common mind in the Lord.   (And here's a request for you too, my loyal comrade: please help these women. They have struggled hard in the gospel alongside me, as have Clement and my other fellow-workers, whose names are in the book of life.)
