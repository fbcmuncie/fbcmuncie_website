Finding Contentment | Exodus 20:17

Mother Teresa once said: “We cannot do great things on this earth. We can only do little things with great love.” Serving others is a challenge for all of us, yet we must stop and think about the tasks God desires for us. What makes you happy? How do you multiply happiness and joy through service? When you leave this earth, what will you leave behind?

“You shall not covet your neighbor’s house. You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, or his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.”
Exodus 20:17, NIV

God’s truth helps us focus attention on the important things in life. Join us this special Sunday to commit ourselves anew to Christian service.
