Jesus' words in the Sermon on the Mount are not easy. I find myself each week challenged by his elevation of the OT Law. This week, the same is true. When we practically attempt to implement Jesus' teaching, it is very difficult. I am sure that you have heard these words before. They are not new. But as we study them this week, let's allow these hard words to mold us into the people that God has called us to be. 

Please take a few minutes to read this week's passage before coming to worship on Sunday morning via live stream. 

> (Matthew 5:38-42 NTE) "You heard that it was said, “An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.”  But I say to you: don't use violence to resist evil! Instead, when someone hits you on the right cheek, turn the other one towards him.  When someone wants to sue you and take your shirt, let him have your cloak, too.  And when someone forces you to go one mile, go a second one with him.  Give to anyone who asks you, and don't refuse someone who wants to borrow from you.
