This week has been quite the week. For most of us, our world has drastically changed. We are all doing our best to figure out to adjust to the new realities of these difficult days. At the same time, we are in the season of Lent. This season prepares us for Easter. We are walking with Jesus through the difficult days that lead him toward the cross.

This week, we come to another teaching from the Gospel of Matthew. You have likely heard this story. We often call it the story of the Rich Young Ruler. A man comes to Jesus seeking the checklist for eternal life. But Jesus' response catches him off guard. In fact, Jesus' response surprises us. He urges the man to sell his possessions, give the money to the poor, and follow Him. Have you ever struggled with this story? Have you wondered if this requirement would apply to all of us? Join us this week as explore this passage together. 

As you know by now, we will not be meeting in person this week. However, a sermon will be posted on the website. While these are difficult days, I am energized by the work of volunteers at First Baptist to keep ministry going in various areas. You will hear more about this at the conclusion of the sermon video. For now, let me encourage you to read this week's passage. I will include it below from the NTE version.

>(Matthew 19:16-26 NTE) Suddenly a man came up to Jesus. "Teacher," he asked, "what good thing must I do if I'm to possess the life of the age to come?" "Why come to me with questions about what's good?" retorted Jesus. "There is One who is good! If you want to enter into life, keep the commandments." "Which ones?" he asked."These ones," Jesus answered: " “don't murder, don't commit adultery, don't steal, don't tell lies under oath,  respect your father and mother”, and “love your neighbour as yourself”." "I've, kept the lot," said the young man. "What am I still short of?" "If you want to complete the set," Jesus replied, "go and sell everything you own and give it to the poor. That way you'll, have treasure in heaven! Then come and follow me." When the young man heard him say that, he went away very sad. He had many possessions. Jesus said to his disciples, "I'm telling you the truth: it's very hard for a rich person to get into the kingdom of heaven.  Let me say it again: it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter God's kingdom." The disciples were completely flabbergasted when they heard that. "So who then can be saved?" they asked. Jesus looked round at them. "Humanly speaking," he replied, "it's impossible. But everything's possible with God."
