The Buck Stops Here

Personal responsibility started in the Garden of Eden and continues today. However, many people like to find fault with others instead of looking inward. Whose fault is it? Is it my fault? God is ready to help us in and through our troubles if we ask Him. 

He answered, “I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid.”

And he said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?”

The man said, “The woman you put here with me—she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it.”

Then the Lord God said to the woman, “What is this you have done?”

The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”

-Genesis 3:10-13, NIV

In a moment of truth, where do you stand before God? This message will challenge us to “re-think” our positions of judgment and focus instead on what one person, you, can do to take responsibility for your home, your community, and your world.
