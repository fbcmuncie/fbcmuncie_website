Hearing the Still Small Voice of God

It is easy to become disappointed and despondent during the times in our life when we need to hear from God and we expect a burning bush or a pillar of fire type of response from Him, but it does not happen. Where is God in those times? Does He not hear our earnest prayers? Does He not care enough about us and our situations to respond? We often ask ourselves "is it my fault that God does not respond?" We all have these moments in our lives where our faith in God is tested because we do not hear Him. 

Then He said, “Go out, and stand on the mountain before the Lord.” And behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind tore into the mountains and broke the rocks in pieces before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake; and after the earthquake a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire; and after the fire a still small voice.

-I Kings 19:11-12, NIV

Join us this week as we study how God is present and communicating with us in these situations. The prophet Elijah reminds us of this in his experience, told in 1 Kings 19. As we delve into this scripture we will have a better understanding of how God communicates with us and how we can find His voice in this loud world.
