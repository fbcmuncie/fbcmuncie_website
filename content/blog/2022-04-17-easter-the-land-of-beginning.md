EASTER - The Land of Beginning |  John 21:1-14

There is no greater day in the life of the Church than Easter. On this particular Sunday, we will remember many who have gone before us as we honor those memories with a gift to Vision 2022.

In the 21st chapter of John, the disciple wanted to remind us one more time of the certainty of the resurrection and its impact on the world. The presence of Jesus was real, and John wanted to tell us that it is possible for us to start over, turn the page, and begin afresh and anew with Jesus in our hearts and lives.

“Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, ‘It is the Lord!’ As soon as Simon Peter heard him say, ‘It is the Lord,’ he wrapped his outer garment around him (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the water.” 

John 21:7, NIV

Don’t miss out on the only Easter Sunday of 2022! Be present in person for this day of celebrating the resurrection story and Christ’s victory over death and the grave.
