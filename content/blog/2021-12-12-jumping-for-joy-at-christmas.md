Jumping for Joy at Christmas | Isaiah 35:1-10 &  Luke 2:13-15

We have all been in hard places from time to time, even at Christmas. You are in a hard place if you can’t spend Christmas with a loved one. Or, perhaps there is an empty chair at the kitchen table or an empty place in your heart this Christmas. God knows how you are feeling, and the prophet Isaiah told about the Lord Who would send a deliverer who would rescue God’s people from their captivity. Salvation would come to God’s people. 

They will enter Zion with singing;

    everlasting joy will crown their heads.

Gladness and joy will overtake them,

    and sorrow and sighing will flee away.

Isaiah 35:10b, NIV

When was the last time you jumped for joy about anything? As we worship, God has a special word for your life.
