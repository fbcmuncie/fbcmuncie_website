Fixin’ is a word I grew up with that some people don’t understand. Neither did the people in Jesus’ day fully understand the triumphant entry into Jerusalem. However, God always “plans carefully.” Nothing in the world happens outside God’s view. His royal entry was “courageously performed” even when there was a price on Jesus’ head. 

How would you have entered Jerusalem? Jesus’ “caring proclamation” was His loves’ last appeal. Does it make a difference in your life? Will you hear it? Will you respond to it? If you are fixin’ your life, First Baptist Church of Muncie is a good place to go. Join us this Palm Sunday as we study Jesus’ triumphant entry into Jerusalem in Matthew 21:1-11.
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them, “Go to the village ahead of you, and at once you will find a donkey tied there, with her colt by her. Untie them and bring them to me. If anyone says anything to you, say that the Lord needs them, and he will send them right away.”

This took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet: 

“Say to Daughter Zion,

‘See, your king comes to you,

gentle and riding on a donkey,

and on a colt, the foal of a donkey.’”

The disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them. They brought the donkey and the colt and placed their cloaks on them for Jesus to sit on. A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. The crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed shouted,

“Hosanna to the Son of David!”

“Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!”

“Hosanna in the highest heaven!”

When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked, “Who is this?” 

The crowds answered, “This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.”
