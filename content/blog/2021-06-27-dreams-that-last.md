Dreams That Last

Dreaming in church happens more often than preachers care to admit. But what about dreams that actually describe a vision for your life – that sense of mission, sense of meaning, that feeling your life has significance and the living of your life is important.

Joseph stayed in Egypt, along with all his father’s family. He lived a hundred and ten years and saw the third generation of Ephraim’s children. Also, the children of Makir son of Manasseh were placed at birth on Joseph’s knees.

Then Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die. But God will surely come to your aid and take you up out of this land to the land he promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.” And Joseph made the Israelites swear an oath and said, “God will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry my bones up from this place.”

So Joseph died at the age of a hundred and ten. And after they embalmed him, he was placed in a coffin in Egypt.

Genesis 50:22-26, NIV

Dreams in Scripture often redefined what it meant to believe in God and what it meant to have faith and obedience toward God. This Sunday, you will not want to miss “a time to dream with God” about what He desires your life to become.
