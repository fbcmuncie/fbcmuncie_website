Celebrating the Future

The purpose of the book of Exodus was the fulfillment of God’s covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The covenant had the promise that He would bless them, and they, in turn, would be a blessing to all of the world. This is the same blessing we discussed with the “Blessing of the Children” in August, and it is applicable to all of us as we bear witness to His love, deliverance, forgiveness, and grace.

Then the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, “When Pharaoh says to you, ‘Prove yourselves by working a miracle,’ then you shall say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and cast it down before Pharaoh, that it may become a serpent.’”

Exodus 7:8-9, ESV

God is ready to give us the courage and faith we need to keep going, to keep believing, and to keep working as we celebrate our future with Christ as our guide.
