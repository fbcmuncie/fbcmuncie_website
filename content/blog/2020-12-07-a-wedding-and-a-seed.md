Advent is the season in which we await the coming of Jesus. But hasn't Jesus already come? He came over two thousand years ago. Advent is also the season in which we await the second coming of Jesus. We live in a mode of looking forward to his final redemption of all of Creation. 

This Advent season we are going back to a time and place before the first coming of Jesus. The prophet Isaiah anticipates the coming Messiah. He describes this coming as one of justice and righteousness. He compares it to a wedding or even the planting of a seed.

Join us on Sunday as we explore Isaiah 61:8-11 together. Let me invite you to read this passage ahead of time as we come together virtually at 10:45 AM on Sunday.

> (Isaiah 61:8-11 NIV)  "For I, the Lord, love justice; I hate robbery and wrongdoing. In my faithfulness I will reward my people and make an everlasting covenant with them.  Their descendants will be known among the nations and their offspring among the peoples. All who see them will acknowledge that they are a people the Lord has blessed."  I delight greatly in the Lord; my soul rejoices in my God. For he has clothed me with garments of salvation and arrayed me in a robe of his righteousness, as a bridegroom adorns his head like a priest, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.  For as the soil makes the sprout come up and a garden causes seeds to grow, so the Sovereign Lord will make righteousness and praise spring up before all nations.
