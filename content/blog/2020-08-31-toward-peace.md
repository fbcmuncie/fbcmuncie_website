This past Sunday, I initially planned to cover Philippians 4:4-9. However, we only had time to discuss verses 4:4-7. This is a rich passage. This week, we will move on to verses 8-9. As we study these verses, we do so in the same context. Paul is urging the church at Philippi to resist anxiety and to offer their concerns to God. He assures them that God's peace will provide all they need. In light of this, Paul writes:

> (Philippians 4:8-9 NTE)  For the rest, my dear family, these are the things you should think through: whatever is true, whatever is holy, whatever is upright, whatever is pure, whatever is attractive, whatever has a good reputation; anything virtuous, anything praiseworthy.   And these are the things you should do: what you learned, received, heard and saw in and through me. And the God of peace will be with you. 

As we gather for worship this weekend, we will come together to the Lord's Table. If you are watching via live stream, you will want to have your elements ready at the end of the sermon.
