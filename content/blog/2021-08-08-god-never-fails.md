God Never Fails

The last words of Paul remind us of what he learned in his life. 

For I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time for my departure is near. I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day—and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing.

-2 Timothy 4:6-8, NIV


At my first defense, no one came to my support, but everyone deserted me. May it not be held against them. But the Lord stood at my side and gave me strength, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. And I was delivered from the lion’s mouth. The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom. To him be glory forever and ever. Amen.

-2 Timothy 4:16-18, NIV

What do we need to teach our children? What do we need to teach others? What is important in life? This message will challenge us to look at the brevity of our lives and how we live them. You can make a difference! God never fails us…ever!
