The CCT met again this week. While not much has changed regarding information about our statewide “shelter in place” order, we still felt we should come together and talk about the many ways we are reaching the congregation and what that will look like for the foreseeable future.  


Our Call Team began making calls last week. Every active church family received a phone call. I can hardly put into words what this simple gesture means to some people. Some folks haven’t left their house or had a visitor in weeks. Some people are very outgoing and just enjoy the conversations. It’s another way for us to spread information, but also see if there are any needs the church can help with. I love that we are slowing down and simplifying our means of communication. The other day, CEO of Verizon Hans Vestburg said Verizon has had 800 million calls a day. That’s double the amount of calls that usually would happen on Mother’s Day! And they are lasting 33% longer in duration! I think it’s incredible that in this time of having to avoid physical contact, we are adapting. We are going back to “our roots” so to speak. We are creating deeper, more meaningful relationships through phone calls and video chats. We certainly are blessed to live in a place where these opportunities exist.

Last Wednesday my husband (Chad) and I led the first Facebook live prayer time on the FBC Facebook page. We were (pleasantly!) surprised by the great attendance and fumbled through it a bit. But it was powerful still! During this break from meeting in person, I have prayed during online sermons, at mealtimes, with my kids at night, and several times throughout the day. But, I felt alone. There is something very special about praying together as a congregation. I miss it, and I guess I didn’t realize just how much until that night. I am so thankful for the technology that allows us to “gather” together and cry out our worries, fears and heartfelt prayers. This week, Clif and Julie Davis led our live prayer time and they did amazing! Please, if you’re on Facebook, I encourage you to scroll through the prayer requests and continue to lift those people up in the weeks to come. 


As you all know, we are approaching Holy Week. It goes without saying that this year will be unlike any before. We won’t be piling in our cars and heading to church for Resurrection Sunday. We won’t be going to extended family’s for dinner. We won’t be going out to eat. We won’t be doing an Easter egg hunt with friends. There are lots of things that we won’t be able to do. But we can still get up and put on our Easter best! We can still make our own family dinner! We can still hide eggs in the yard for our kiddos to find! And we can still celebrate a risen Christ! Please join us LIVE via YouTube at 10:45 am for our Easter service! Will it look and feel different? Yes. But it will also humble us, allow us to turn our focus solely to the Lord and give thanks for His ultimate sacrifice. 


I look forward to praying, praising and worshipping with you all!
