The Great Priority

What is your game plan for this confused and uncertain world?  
Learn who you are…lose yourself in self-forgetfulness…and you win!
But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.

-Matthew 6:33, NIV
Someone may need to guide you along the way, so hold out your hand...Jesus will lead you around the bases of life.

Please join us this Sunday morning at 10:45 in person or virtually.
