Greetings!


I don't know about all of you, but I sure am learning a lot about myself in these last several months. If you would have told me in January all of the stuff that was coming my way, I would have ran the other way! It's interesting how capable and strong we are when we have to be! I'd say one of my toughest lessons has been not being able to plan ahead or have much knowledge of even what next week might hold. I literally am living day to day. Anyone else feel like that? Whew, it is challenging for me! I'm a routine, organized, plan ahead, control freak kind of gal. This pandemic has made my normal way of doing and thinking incredibly difficult. These traits are at my core, it's how I'm made, right? I believe in these last few months, God has been speaking to me about letting go. I really don't have to plan every detail, or spend an embarrassing amount of time agonizing over whether or not everything will go perfectly. I don't have to control every situation (this one is real hard ya'll!) And probably one of the most timely things God has shown me is that I can still love through disagreements and opposing opinions/beliefs. I am guilty of taking things personally, when that was never the intent. My hurt feelings then got in the way of how I thought about or perceived certain people or situations moving forward. With the continuous division in this nation, I'm so thankful God opened my eyes to these things. It's almost guaranteed that we will have a conversation with someone who thinks and feels differently than we do. That's OK. Let's love each other anyway! Let's challenge ourselves to build each other up even when it seems hard, or unfair. And let's not forget that in this time of constant change and uncertainty, we are so blessed to have a God that continues to show us He is in control. 


One of the things I've enjoyed through this is writing to you all. Sometimes I've struggled to find the right words. Sometimes the information seemed too "heavy" to send in an email. So I think this is an appropriate time to say thank you! We have thrown a lot of information at you since March, and there were even times that we just didn't have the answers. You have been patient, kind and understanding. I have felt encouraged by those of you that have reached out. Thank you for all the support! I definitely didn't know what I was getting into when I agreed to the clerk position last year! Haha! But as I've mentioned before, the CCT has been thoughtful and informed during our meetings which has helped make my job so much easier.  We met this month to discuss our next steps. Read on to learn more about our transition to indoor service!


## What Will Change?

**When and where:**  We will start meeting inside for worship services starting Sunday Aug 2nd. \*Please note that we will return to our normal combined service time of 10:45 this Sunday.

**Entrance/Exit:**  For everyone's safety, please have your mask on before entering the building. Enter through the main doors on Adams Street at the front of the church. If you need access to the elevator, you may enter through the elevator doors in the circle drive. Please exit the church through the same doors that you entered the church. There will be an usher to dismiss people by rows so that we aren't all exiting at the same time. 

**Restrooms:** The main restroom to the right of the pulpit will be the only restroom available for use. 

**Seating:** As you enter the sanctuary, please allow appropriate distance between yourself and the group ahead of you. Use the outer aisles, along the windows, to enter pews. (Please do not use the center aisle). When choosing your seat, allow 2 empty rows between families. The balcony will not be available for seating. 

**Fellowship:** Please restrict your fellowship in the sanctuary to smiles and waves. If you choose to socialize, we ask that you do it outside of the church building. 

*Reminder*  The rest of the church building will be closed to attendees. This will help to minimize our cleaning costs. 


## What Will Stay the Same?

**Masks:**  Masks are required. Adult and child size masks will also be available at the welcome tables upon entry. 

**Self Screening:**  If you have been around anyone who's tested positive for COVID-19 or has had COVID-19 symptoms, or if you have any of the symptoms, please stay home.

**Offering, Communion and Sanitation:** We will continue to have welcome tables set up with an offering box and hand sanitizer. We will have communion on the first Sunday of each month. On those Sundays, there will be individual communion packets available at the tables upon entry. We kindly ask that you dispose of your trash on your way out of the sanctuary.

**Children:** Children are welcome! However, there will be no child care or children's classes through August. Feel free to bring coloring books/crayons or something quiet for your little ones to do. We know this is not the norm for them and it's difficult for them to be still and quiet the whole time :)

**Virtual Service:**  We will continue to offer live virtual services! As I stated above, the live stream will change back to **10:45 AM** starting this Sunday.

**No Shared Materials:**  You may want to bring your own bible. There will be no bibles, hymnals, bulletins or handouts of any kind.
 
Again, I know this is a lot. And things change, a lot. Please feel free to reach out to me or anyone on the CCT with any questions or concerns that I did not cover.
