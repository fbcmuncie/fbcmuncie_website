When A Christian Sins | I John 3:1-10

What can wash away my sins? Nothing but the blood of Jesus…that is the popular hymn of faith, but what really happens to a Christian when one keeps on sinning.

“Everyone who sins breaks the law; in fact, sin is lawlessness. But you know that he appeared so that he might take away our sins. And in him is no sin. No one who lives in him keeps on sinning.”

I John 3:4-6a
