Receiving the Gift | Luke 15:1-7

Jesus’ coming gives hope to the world. The challenges of the Christmas season can bring direction to the lost, and a path forward that magnifies God’s love and grace. It is easy to be misguided, misdirected, or misinformed, but Christ brings clarity to the moments of our lives that are most important. 

I say to you that likewise there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine just persons who need no repentance.

Luke 15:7, NKJV
