The Impact of the Gospel

A watered-down Gospel is really “no gospel at all.” Jesus talked about living and dying for one’s faith, and that is not always the easy road with little or no sacrifice.  Jesus talks about living by faith…venturing out by faith…walking not by sight, but by faith…living sacrificially, not selfishly.

Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the temple courts. He looked around at everything, but since it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve.

The next day as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus was hungry. Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to find out if it had any fruit. When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs. Then he said to the tree, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again.” And his disciples heard him say it.

On reaching Jerusalem, Jesus entered the temple courts and began driving out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money-changers and the benches of those selling doves, and would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts. And as he taught them, he said, “Is it not written: ‘My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations'? But you have made it 'a den of robbers.’”

The chief priests and the teachers of the law heard this and began looking for a way to kill him, for they feared him because the whole crowd was amazed at his teaching.

-Mark 11:11-18, NIV

Living the Gospel is a choice Christians make. God’s love is unmatched, and He desires to live out LOVE through you. Let us all be challenged to magnify the Gospel through our lives. This is your invitation…
