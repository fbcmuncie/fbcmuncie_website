The Message to the Church | Revelation 2:1-7

Revelation, the last book of the Bible has sometimes been abandoned, and at other times, abused. There were seven churches God needed to address and FBC Muncie is included in that group. There were descriptions, commendations, and counsel for these churches. Attention was given to the power of Christ and our need to be the “light to the world.”

Let anyone who has ears to hear listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers, I will give the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.

-Revelation 2:7, NIV

Come and learn about the choices we have to make to follow and find the will of God for the future.
