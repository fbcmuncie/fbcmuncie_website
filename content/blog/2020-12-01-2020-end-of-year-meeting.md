Greetings!

I hope everyone had a wonderful Thanksgiving! This year has seemed to almost stand still at times, while at others it flew by leaving me trying to catch my breath. Nonetheless, here we are going into December! Let’s give ourselves a little pat on the back, we made it!! 


As the end of the year approaches, we are due to have our end of year business meeting. Like everything else this year, we have had to put our heads together to find a way to do this without meeting in person. Luckily, we have had some practice with virtual services and will be conducting our business meeting this way. 

Here’s what you need to know!


**What**: End of Year Business Meeting (2021 Budget Proposal, New CCT Members)

**Who**: Any active member 

**When**: Wednesday December 16th at 7:00pm

**Where**: [Our church YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/c/fbcmuncieorg) or the FBC [Website](https://fbcmuncie.org) 

**How**: Tune in to our LIVE streaming business meeting from one of the options above. There are TWO ways to cast your votes! Please read below and decide which is best for you!

**Call in Your Vote** - You will be given a phone number to call. Once the voting begins, you can call the number and speak with a CCT member to cast your vote. *Note- you do not need to give your name if you prefer to be anonymous.* 

**Text in Your Vote-** If you are an active member and 18 years or older, you will receive a text message asking for your participation in the meeting. Follow the directions in the text message and you will receive a virtual ballot. Once you cast your vote, you hit submit. Easy peasy!   





Here’s what will be on the ballot this year. Please contact me if you misplace these links. We are not posting them on the blog.

As we have said all year, these are unprecedented times. This is something we have never had to do or plan for. This is the safest way to have our meeting this year and we feel this is the most inclusive way to do it. Please, do not hesitate to reach out to a CCT member with questions. This is new to everyone!


As we are heading into the final month of 2020, I’m sure most of us couldn’t be more thrilled. To say this has been a rough year is probably a major understatement for many of us. But, there’s something about the new year that urges us to be open to a “reset” and a positive outlook on what’s to come. I pray we all go into 2021 with fresh eyes and hearts full of the love of Jesus, ready to see where He is leading us and willing to show His love to all those we know and meet along the way!

Many blessings to you and your family!

Colleen Massoth for the CCT
