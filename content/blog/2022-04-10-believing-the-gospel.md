Believing the Gospel |  Matthew 23:23-24

Believing the Gospel is one of the great challenges of our day. So many people are skeptical or hesitant or doubtful of what God can do. Think about it! Why do people living in the world today distort life and faith and religion? There is order, and then, there is disorder. People live with their own set of assumptions, but isn’t it important to “believe the Gospel” and its truth for everyday living? The old expression is, “some people can’t see the forest for the trees.”  

“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faith. These you ought to have done, without leaving the others undone. Blind guides, who strain out a gnat and swallow a camel!”

Matthew 23:23-24, NKJV

How do you view the world and its challenges? Jesus died on the cross for our sins. On this Palm Sunday, let’s re-discover the hope from the Gospel.
