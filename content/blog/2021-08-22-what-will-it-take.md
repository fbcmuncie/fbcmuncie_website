What Will it Take?

What will it take? What will it cost? What will be involved? This Old Testament story from Isaiah reminds us of biblical history that marks a moment of decision. What will it take for our hearts to be renewed, revitalized, rechallenged, and redirected? 

“Before she was in labor, she gave birth;
Before her pain came,
She delivered a male child.
Who has heard such a thing?
Who has seen such things?
Shall the earth be made to give birth in one day?
Or shall a nation be born at once?
For as soon as Zion was in labor,
She gave birth to her children.”

-Isaiah 66:7-8, NKJV


The answers found in Scripture lead us to a time of invitation where one must decide. Are you ready for a change in direction in your life? Come and be challenged to learn how Isaiah found his path forward.
