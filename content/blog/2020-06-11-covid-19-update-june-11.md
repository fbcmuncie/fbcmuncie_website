Greetings!

As we move into the summer months, we are approaching Stage 5 in Governor Holcomb’s plan. As stated in my last blog, we have chosen to align with the stages instead of a specific date. At this time we have no reason to believe we won’t continue moving through the stages as predicted. With that being said, we plan to have in person service starting Sunday July 5th! Won’t that be a great day! Let me fill you in….

We will be holding all services for the month of July *outside* at **9:15 AM**! The CCT met via zoom on June 9th to set the planning in motion. I’ll be honest, we have a lot left to discuss! As you can imagine, there is a ton of information to sift through. We are continuing to observe local businesses, daycares and other churches as they begin to reopen. We will also continue to follow the CDC’s recommendations and those stated by Gov Holcomb. Unfortunately, even with all of the information available, there isn’t a step-by-step guide specifically for FBC Muncie. Please be prayerful and patient as we figure out what our own best practices will be. The CCT will meet again on Tues. June 23 to finalize all the details concerning our in person meetings. We will get that information to you in a timely manner so that we can all be prepared as we come together again.

This has proven to be a very challenging and unique situation that none of us were prepared for or have experience with. Sometimes, even the thought of discussing our next steps is overwhelming. But I have to say, every member on our CCT has been a crucial part in getting us to where we are. At the end of all of this, maybe some will say we did too little, some will say we did too much. What I can say, without a doubt, is that every decision was based on love and respect for the whole congregation. The thoughtfulness and care I see poured out at every meeting is inspiring. It’s amazing to see that during something so uncharted, we remain united as a team. Although things may not be exactly as they were, we are making the most of our resources and keeping a posture of thanksgiving and positivity with every new step forward. We are blessed.

I am really looking forward to seeing you all in person! Until then, continue to join our LIVE FaceBook prayer time every Wednesday at 7 PM and our LIVE sermons on our [church Youtube Channel](http://youtube.com/c/fbcmuncieorg) or the [FBC website](http://fbcmuncie.org/)  For the kiddos we are bringing a super cool VBS right to your living rooms June 30-July 2!

Thank you,
