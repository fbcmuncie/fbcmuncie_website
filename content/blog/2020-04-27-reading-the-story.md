As we work out way through the Sermon on the Mount, we are building each week on Jesus' words in Matthew 5-7. This week, we come to a very familiar passage. In fact, we covered this scripture back in February. This time around, we will look at this passage in light of the rest of God's story. With multiple readers this week, we will work our way trough God's story in order to properly read Matthew 5:13-16. I think you will enjoy hearing the voices of those you miss seeing each week at church. 

This **Sunday, May 3** is the first Sunday of the month. We usually celebrate communion together. While we will not be gathered together in person this week, we would invite you to celebrate the Lord's Supper with your family at the end of the sermon video. You will want to have the elements ready when you sit down to watch the sermon. You can use bread or crackers, wine or grape juice (or really any drink that you might have available). You might want to set up a table (perhaps with a cloth) for the elements before you gather together to watch the sermon and sing the songs. 

If you have children and would like to involve them in the celebration, let me direct you to this guide. You can simply stop the video and walk through this on your own.

The passage for the week is Matthew 5:13-16. I will include it below in the NTE version.

>(Matthew 5:13-16 NTE) "You're the salt of the earth! But if the salt becomes tasteless, how is it going to get salty again? It's no good for anything. You might as well throw it out and walk all over it. "You're the light of the world! A city can't be hidden if it's on top of a hill.  People don't light a lamp and put it under a bucket; they put it on a lampstand. Then it gives light to everybody in the house.  That's how you must shine your light in front of people! Then they will see what wonderful things you do, and they'll give glory to your father in heaven.
