The Real Race

There are many races in our lives today. We race to school, to the store, and home. We sometimes race to church. The author of Hebrews describes “the race” in the 11th and 12th chapters. There is a long list of those who have run the race faithfully, and the truth lies in how you and I will run the race in life.

"Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles. And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God."

-Hebrews 12:1-2, NIV

Is there a direction? Is there a course to run? Where is the finish line? This Sunday, come and see how far you have yet to go in the race of life. How will your race begin and end?
