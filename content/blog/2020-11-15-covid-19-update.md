FBC Family,

We informed you earlier this week that the governor has given new guidelines for our state. To clarify, he has done away with the 5-stage plan that we initially aligned ourselves with and is now looking at each county individually. Indiana will now operate from a [Color Coded Map](https://www.coronavirus.in.gov/2393.htm), with each color having a certain set of restrictions. At this time, Delaware County is orange. Below you will see the new guidelines that go into effect for our county today. 

### COUNTIES IN ORANGE

- Social gatherings—inside or outside—are limited to 50 people.
- Special, seasonal, or commercial events planned for more than 50 people need to get a safety plan approved by the local health department.
- Attendance at winter indoor K-12 extracurricular and co-curricular events is limited to 25% capacity.
- Capacity in common areas and break rooms should be reduced and users should be socially distanced.
- Community rec sports leagues and tournaments may continue with limited participant attendance, with required personnel and parents/guardians only.

Even though as a church we are exempt from these mandates and guidelines, we have always aligned ourselves with Governor Holcomb’s COVID-related recommendations out of an abundance of caution for the congregation. We will continue to do so in an effort to keep everyone safe. With that said, **we unfortunately will begin VIRTUAL ONLY worship service starting next Sunday, November 22nd**. This will look much like it does now if you are watching virtually, or have in the past. There will be a LIVE stream every Sunday where we can all watch together. Of course it’s always available to watch at a later time as well. We have worked really hard to make sure that in times like this we can still provide meaningful, quality worship to you at home! You’ll find the links to our YouTube channel and our website below. We hope you will **join us virtually on Sundays for the live stream at 10:45 AM!**

The CCT will continue to monitor the latest updates regarding our county and will provide any news or changes to you in a timely manner. We appreciate your understanding and support through these challenging times.
