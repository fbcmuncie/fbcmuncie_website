They Went Out Singing | Matthew 26:17-30


You know it is interesting to think how many ways a person can influence a room…even if that room has only one door. The Upper Room, in which Jesus gathered his disciples, had only one door. But just think how many different people entered and left that room. Let’s talk to the disciples and see and feel what they felt in that room. 

He replied, “Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, ‘The Teacher says: My appointed time is near. I am going to celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house.’” So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.

Matthew 26:18-19, NIV

Come and worship as we enter the room with only one door, and see how we leave the room…
