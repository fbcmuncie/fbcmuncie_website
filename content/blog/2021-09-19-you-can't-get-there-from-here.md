You Can't Get There From Here

The primary text for this week’s message comes from just seven words – “You have never been this way before.” It is sometimes easy to forget how many new roads we travel in life. One of the continuing needs each of us has, whatever our age or circumstance, is for some newness in our lives –new experiences, new challenges, a sense of adventure, a need to risk, and some open-endedness in life. This is true for all of us, and it is a basic need we all feel. 


Joshua told the people, “Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the Lord will do amazing things among you.”

Joshua 3:5, NIV


God offers us creative energy that is able to flow through our lives, so let us never lose sight of a God who can do the incredible and the impossible. The HOPE of the world depends on it!
