Each week in the season of Epiphany, we continue through the story of Jesus. This year, we are walking through John's account of Jesus' life. We do not have time to cover every story. So let me encourage you to read through John during this season. If you are keeping up, you should have the first two chapters read by this point. This week, we come to John 3:1-8, the story of Nicodemus. I will provide it below from the NTE version. 

If you enjoy reading this version, you can find it [here on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Kingdom-New-Testament-Paperback-Contemporary/dp/0062064924/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=nt+wright+new+testament&qid=1610983135&sr=8-2). It is called *The Kingdom New Testament*. 


> (John 3:1-8 NTE)  There was a man of the Pharisees called Nicodemus, a ruler of the Judaeans.   He came to Jesus by night. 'Rabbi,' he said to him. 'We know that you're a teacher who's come from God. Nobody can do these signs that you're doing, unless God is with him.'  'Let me tell you the solemn truth,' replied Jesus. 'Unless someone has been born from above, they won't be able to see God's kingdom.'  'How can someone possibly be born', asked Nicodemus, 'when they're old? You're not telling me they can go back a second time into the mother's womb and be born, are you?'  'I'm telling you the solemn truth,' replied Jesus. 'Unless someone is born from water and spirit, they can't enter God's kingdom.   Flesh is born from flesh, but spirit is born from spirit.   Don't be surprised that I said to you, You must be born from above.   The wind blows where it wants to, and you hear the sound it makes; but you don't know where it's coming from or where it's going to. That's what it's like with someone who is born from the spirit.'
