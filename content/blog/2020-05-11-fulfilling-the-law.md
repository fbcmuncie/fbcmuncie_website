It was wonderful to be able to gather live on Sunday to celebrate Mother's Day. While it is not easy to not be together in person, I am encouraged by the participation in our virtual services. I hope that you were all able to enjoy the mothers in your lives and helped them feel special.

This week, we turn back our series on the Sermon on the Mount. The text for this Sunday will set up a crucial dynamic that will help us understand Jesus' words throughout the sermon. Without a proper understanding of Jesus' role in relationship to the Old Testament, it will be difficult for us to interpret the verses that follow. 

How do you view the Old Testament? Is it difficult to make sense of the rules and regulations outlined here? Have you ever wondered if the Old Testament is *old school*, something written for a people who had not experienced the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus? 

As we resume our study on the Sermon on the Mount this week, we will consider Jesus' relationship to the Old Testament Law. I hope you will take a few minutes to read our passage as you prepare for worship. 

>(Matthew 5:17-20 NTE) "Don't suppose that I came to destroy the law or the prophets. I didn't come to destroy them; I came to fulfil them!  I'm telling you the truth: until heaven and earth disappear, not one stroke, not one dot, is going to disappear from the law, until it's all come true.  So anyone who relaxes a single one of these commandments, even the little ones, and teaches that to people, will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But anyone who does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. "Yes, let me tell you: unless your covenant behaviour is far superior to that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never get in to the kingdom of heaven."
