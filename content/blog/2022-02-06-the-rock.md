The Rock | Matthew 16:13-20

Life questions are important. Who are You? What will I be when I grow up? What values will one follow? Peter is a great director who taught others how to make choices that honor Jesus Christ. He teaches us how to utilize certain basic principles that will cause us to build a solid “rock” character. How do you build your life? How do you build Christ’s Church? How do you claim victory with Christ? 

“But what about you?” he asked. “Who do you say I am?”

Simon Peter answered, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.”

-Matthew 16:15-16, NIV

This message from Scripture gives us a prescription one can follow to find healing and hope through the Gospel. I look forward to seeing you in worship this Sunday!
