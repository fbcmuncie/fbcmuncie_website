Thank you to James Heimlich for preaching last week and helping us reflect on the past year. I wish you all a Happy New Year as we turn our calendars over this week to 2021. The new year brings us a fresh start in many ways including a new sermon series. We will spend the seasons of Epiphany, Lent, and Easter in John's gospel. You can read more about the series in the [January Visitor](http://visitor.fbcmuncie.org/visitor_2021-01.pdf).

This week, we will consider John's purpose in writing his gospel. Let me encourage you to read these verses as you prepare for worship on Sunday.

> (John 20:30-31 NTE)  Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which aren't written in this book.   But these ones are written so that you may believe that the Messiah, the son of God, is none other than Jesus; and that, with this faith, you may have life in his name.
