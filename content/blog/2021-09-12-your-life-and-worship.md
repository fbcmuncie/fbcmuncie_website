Your Life & Worship

No matter how young or old, it is important to learn how we think about living our lives as an act of worship. When one begins to move behind our wants to our needs, then we can begin to truly live in the Spirit of Christ. When did life become so complicated and how do we fix it? Life can become an act of worship when we realize how valuable life is, and that value makes it sacred. 


During harvest time, three of the thirty chief warriors came down to David at the cave of Adullam, while a band of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim. At that time David was in the stronghold, and the Philistine garrison was at Bethlehem. David longed for water and said, “Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!” So the three mighty warriors broke through the Philistine lines, drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem and carried it back to David. But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out before the Lord. “Far be it from me, Lord, to do this!” he said. “Is it not the blood of men who went at the risk of their lives?” And David would not drink it.

Such were the exploits of the three mighty warriors.

-2 Samuel 23:13-17, NIV


David taught us a valuable lesson that he modeled for others regarding worship and its meaning. It is never too late to develop a deeper understanding of worship as it is the center of one’s relationship with God.
