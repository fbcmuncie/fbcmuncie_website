As we continue to move through John's gospel this week, we come to a key story in chapter 2. Before you read this week's passage, let me encourage you to go back and read (or write out) all of chapter 1. We will not have time to cover every story, and there are key parts of chapter 1 that you will need to read (Jesus' baptism and the calling of the first disciples). 

This week's story is found exclusively in John's gospel. In other words, it is not recorded in Matthew, Mark, and Luke. In fact, I am not sure I have preached on this passage since coming to First Baptist in 2008. Let me encourage you to read it as you prepare for worship.

> (John 2:1-11 NTE)  On the third day there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee. Jesus' mother was there,   and Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the wedding.  The wine ran out. Jesus' mother came over to him. 'They haven't got any wine!' she said.  'Oh, Mother!' replied Jesus. 'What's that got do to do with you and me? My time hasn't come yet.'  His mother spoke to the servants. 'Do whatever he tells you,' she said.  Six stone water-jars were standing there, ready for use in the Jewish purification rites. Each held about twenty or thirty gallons.  'Fill the jars with water,' said Jesus to the servants. And they filled them, right up to the brim.  'Now draw some out', he said, 'and take it to the chief steward.' They did so.  When the chief steward tasted the water that had turned into wine (he didn't know where it had come from, but the servants who had drawn the water knew), he called the bridegroom.  'What everybody normally does', he said, 'is to serve the good wine first, and then the worse stuff when people have had plenty to drink. But you've kept the good wine till now!'  This event, in Cana of Galilee, was the first of Jesus' signs. He displayed his glory, and his disciples believed in him.
