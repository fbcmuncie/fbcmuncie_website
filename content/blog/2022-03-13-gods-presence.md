God's Presence | Acts 1:8

Have you ever tried to imagine what it would have been like to be an actual disciple in the days of Jesus? Jesus challenged every goal they had. It was the kind of school that was somewhat unstructured, but at the same time, it left no presumption unchallenged. Jesus focused their values in different directions. He exposed them to a world that was so much larger than they had ever dreamed before. 

“‘But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.’”

Acts 1:8, NIV

Come and allow Christ to expand your world and He seeks to give you real and abundant life.
