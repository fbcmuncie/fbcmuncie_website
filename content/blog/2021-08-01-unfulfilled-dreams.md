Unfulfilled Dreams

In October 1832, Franz Schubert began work on his Symphony No.8 in B Minor. He started with his piano outlines. He put all of his creativity into this project, and it soon became apparent this work would far exceed anything he had previously achieved. In two short months, he had finished the first two movements, and after creating one page of the third movement, he quit, and this work became known as his “Unfinished Symphony.” Have you ever left something undone or unfinished? 

Then the Lord said to him, “This is the land I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob when I said, ‘I will give it to your descendants.’ I have let you see it with your eyes, but you will not cross over into it.”

Deuteronomy 34:4, NIV

What does God want us to start…or finish? This message from the life of Moses will give us a sense of how Moses navigated his life with God’s presence to fulfill God’s plan. What does God want you to dream about? What can you do to fulfill God’s dream for your life?
