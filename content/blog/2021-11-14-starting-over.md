Starting Over | John 3:1-9

Nicodemas was a person of prestige, power, and position in his community. He was looked up to by everyone, but there was something missing from his life. He was seeking something, but he didn’t know exactly what…almost like a hungry individual standing at a refrigerator but not knowing what he or she wants to eat. What spiritual hunger exists in your life?

Jesus replied, “Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again."

John 3:3, NIV

Perhaps you have tried over and over again, and still feel like you are failing to live up to God’s expectations. God wants us to ask Him for help. God wants you to come to Him for the answers you are seeking. When was the last time you felt the Holy Spirit lead you to do something larger than yourself? Come and learn how God is ready to receive you and bless you and your future with Him.
