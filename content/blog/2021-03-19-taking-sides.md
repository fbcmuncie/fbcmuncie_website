In the New Testament, the most frequently mentioned person from the Old Testament is Moses. As a prophet, Moses spoke of the coming Messiah and His suffering. The proclamation of new laws from the mountain (Matthew 5:1) presents Jesus as the living voice from Sinai.
“Now when Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down. His disciples came to him, and he began to teach them.”

Matthew 5:1-2, NIV

“So he stood at the entrance to the camp and said, ‘Whoever is for the Lord, come to me.’”

Exodus 32:26, NIV
This message focuses on the call for a man or a woman to “take sides.” There is no room to come halfway. By the time the day is over, you must make: 1) a personal decision; 2) a public decision; 3) a prompt decision. Are you going to stand on the Lord’s side?
