Achieving Greatness | Acts 3:1-11

In Jesus’ day, the name of a person represented all that was known about one’s character and deeds. The name of Jesus meant more than the reputation of the historical Jesus. Several names included: servant – holy and righteous One – author – and the implied title of “the Prophet” from Deuteronomy 18: 15-16. What does your name mean? How do others perceive you when your name is called? 

When all the people saw him walking and praising God, they recognized him as the same man who used to sit begging at the temple gate called Beautiful, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.

Acts 3:9-10
