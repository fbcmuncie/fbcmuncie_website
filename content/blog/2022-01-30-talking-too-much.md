Talking Too Much? | James 3:1-12

I think all agree we live in a “wordy” society. Recently, it seems people seem willing to say anything they want, whenever they want. Just look at social media and see how people speak ill of others they don’t even know. People express opinions without any knowledge of facts or truth. What does the Bible say about the words we speak?

With the tongue we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who are made in God’s likeness. Blessing and cursing come out of the same mouth. My brothers and sisters, these things should not be this way.

James 3:9-10, NIV

Have you ever felt like telling someone, “I’m sorry, but I think you have used up all your words for today!” The Scriptures encourage us to “weigh our words carefully.” Find out how by being in worship and doing something we need more of… “listening” to the Word of God.
