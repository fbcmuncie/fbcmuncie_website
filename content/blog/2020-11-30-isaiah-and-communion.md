We continue this week through the season of Advent. Thank you to Bill Eidson for a wonderful sermon to kick off the season. Also, thank you to Brian Green and his family for decorating the church. While we are not able to be present in person, it is wonderful to see the decorations on the live stream. As Bill mentioned, we are reading the prophets this Advent season. These passages are reminders of a waiting people, longing for the coming Messiah. The season of Advent is about anticipation and expectancy that God will show up. This week, we come to another passage from Isaiah. I will include it below for you to read as you prepare for worship on Sunday

Also, let me remind you that we will be coming together to the Lord's Table on Sunday. Let me encourage you to prepare your own elements (bread and wine/juice) as you join the live stream on Sunday morning. While the taking of communion is better in person, we do not want to neglect this important practice. God is present in this celebration and is not limited to time and place. At the end of the sermon, we will come together to receive the body and blood of Christ.

Here is this week's passage from the NIV translation.

> (Isaiah 40:1-11 NIV)  Comfort, comfort my people, says your God.  Speak tenderly to Jerusalem, and proclaim to her that her hard service has been completed, that her sin has been paid for, that she has received from the Lord's hand double for all her sins.  A voice of one calling: "In the wilderness prepare the way for the Lord; make straight in the desert a highway for our God.  Every valley shall be raised up, every mountain and hill made low; the rough ground shall become level, the rugged places a plain.  And the glory of the Lord will be revealed, and all people will see it together. For the mouth of the Lord has spoken."  A voice says, "Cry out." And I said, "What shall I cry?" "All people are like grass, and all their faithfulness is like the flowers of the field.  The grass withers and the flowers fall, because the breath of the Lord blows on them. Surely the people are grass.  The grass withers and the flowers fall, but the word of our God endures forever."  You who bring good news to Zion, go up on a high mountain. You who bring good news to Jerusalem, lift up your voice with a shout, lift it up, do not be afraid; say to the towns of Judah, "Here is your God!"  See, the Sovereign Lord comes with power, and he rules with a mighty arm. See, his reward is with him, and his recompense accompanies him.  He tends his flock like a shepherd: He gathers the lambs in his arms and carries them close to his heart; he gently leads those that have young.
