Go and Be the People of God | Colossians 1:1-6

Life is composed of many questions, and the Apostle Paul to his holy and faithful brothers and sisters in Colossae these words: “Grace and peace to you from God our Father.” These words are filled with tremendous spiritual truth, and we can learn together in worship today how to be holy and faithful in Christ. Who are God’s people? What are their characteristics?

We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you, because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love you have for all God’s people—the faith and love that spring from the hope stored up for you in heaven and about which you have already heard in the true message of the gospel that has come to you. In the same way, the gospel is bearing fruit and growing throughout the whole world—just as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and truly understood God’s grace.

Colossians 1:3-6, NIV

Being the people of God is an ongoing journey of faith and one that is not destined for anything other than magnifying the Glory of God. To God be the Glory, Great Things He has Done! That is both the call and the benediction of one’s faith.
