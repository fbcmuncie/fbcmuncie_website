Discovering God's Wisdom | Daniel 1:11-21

Daniel is an Old Testament character with much to offer. He was a young man who was smart, intelligent, sharp, gifted, and who stood firm and true. What lessons can one learn about practicing oneâ€™s faith from Daniel? His wisdom will be a good guide for valuable lessons one can pocket in early 2022 for a successful year. 

To these four young men God gave knowledge and understanding of all kinds of literature and learning. And Daniel could understand visions and dreams of all kinds.

Daniel 1:17, NIV

Blessings to you and your family as 2022 begins!
