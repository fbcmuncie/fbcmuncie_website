The Gospel of Christmas | Romans 1:15-17

If one needs to summarize the story of Christmas, the Book of Romans would be a good start. If you want to read the verses which are at the heart of Christianity, this is the text. This Word of God is for you and me to declare: “I am not ashamed of the Gospel. It is the saving power of God for everyone who has faith…”. One cannot understand the history of celebrating Christ apart from the Gospel. 

“For in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed—a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: ‘The righteous will live by faith.’”

Romans 1:17, NIV

Come, worship, and experience the awe and wonder of the season as we celebrate Christ’s impact on the world.
