We come this Sunday to our last passage from our Sermon on the Mount series. We could do a bit more but will move into a series on Gratitude the following Sunday. By the way, if you have a story to share, I would love to hear from you. Please fill out [this form](http://bit.ly/fbc-thanks).

This week, we will be in Matthew 7:1-5. This is another familiar passage. Let me encourage you to read it before coming to worship on Sunday. I will include it below from the NTE (New Testament for Everyone) version.

> (Matthew 7:1-5 NTE)  'Don't judge people, and you won't be judged yourself.   You'll be judged, you see, by the judgment you use to judge others! You'll be measured by the measuring-rod you use to measure others!   Why do you stare at the splinter in your neighbour's eye, but ignore the plank in your own?   How can you say to your neighbour, "Here – let me get that splinter out of your eye," when you've got the plank in your own?   You're just play-acting! First take the plank out of your own eye, and then you'll see clearly enough to take the splinter out of your neighbour's eye.
