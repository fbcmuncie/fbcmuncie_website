As we continue our series on gratitude/thanksgiving this week, we will have more testimonies. Most of you already know that we will not be meeting in person this week. But you can join the [live stream](https://fbcmuncie.org) to participate. If you are not able to join us on Sunday at 10:45 AM, you can watch later. 

For the past few weeks, we have been talking about the importance of expressing gratitude to God for his provision. This week, we will continue in this theme. We will talk about the history of the Thanksgiving holiday and how it is intertwined with difficult situations. We will also be considering Ephesians 5:19-20. I will include it below for you to read as you prepare for worship. 

I am saddened that we will not be able to share a meal together this Sunday as it would have been our annual harvest dinner. We continue to pray for this pandemic to end, and for our normal routines to resume. But as we wait, we trust that God is in control and will provide for us.

> (Ephesians 5:19-20 NTE)  Speak to each other in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and chanting in your heart to the Lord,   always giving thanks for everything to God the father in the name of our Lord Jesus the Messiah.
