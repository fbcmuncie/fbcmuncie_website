As Dr. Bruce Cochran reminded us in his sermon, we can't really think our way into a great relationship with God. Some of what God has planned seems like foolishness to those who are trying to reason through faith ideas.

But wait! I have a lot of good ideas! I bet you do, too. Unfortunately, our good ideas may not be "God ideas." This Sunday, as we continue to move into the Lenten season and focus on Jesus's path to the cross, we'll take a look at some of Simon Peter's ideas. Our time together will focus on Matthew 16:13-23. The NIV text of this passage is below, and I encourage you to read it in preparation for this week's message:

When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, “Who do people say the Son of Man is?”

They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”

“But what about you?” he asked. “Who do you say I am?”

Simon Peter answered, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.”

Jesus replied, “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven. And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.” Then he ordered his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah.

From that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.

Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. “Never, Lord!” he said. “This shall never happen to you!”

Jesus turned and said to Peter, “Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns.”
