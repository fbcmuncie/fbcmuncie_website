Giving Thanks | Luke 17:11-19

Thanksgiving is just around the corner, and family and football are foremost on most people's minds. But what does it mean to have a thankful heart? How does one express thanksgiving in a manner that pleases God? Can you imagine what it would be like if all the churches in the world stopped giving thanks to God? What would the world become?

One of them, when he saw he was healed, came back, praising God in a loud voice. He threw himself at Jesus’ feet and thanked him—and he was a Samaritan.

Luke 17:15-16, NIV

With the fall season of thanksgiving, leaves change, and so should our lives. We should become more like Christ and His love. All things are possible with God. Saying and practicing THANK YOU with your life is one way to start.
