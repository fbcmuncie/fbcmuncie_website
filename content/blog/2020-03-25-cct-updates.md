The CCT met again last night to discuss the recent stay at home order issued by Governor Holcomb. We will continue to meet virtually as needed to discern any changes in the state mandates and how they will affect our FBC family.

We will send a more detailed version of the notes once the CCT has had a chance to review them. Until then, here’s an overview of our meeting.

With the support of the CCT, Pastor Wade and chairman of the diaconate, Brian Green, made the decision to cancel in-person worship services through April 26th. We will make sure that shut-ins and those without access to online services receive a mailed copy of each sermon.

We have decided to close the church office until April 8th, as ordered by the latest state mandate. We will update our church voicemail to provide other ways to contact the church if necessary. We will decide how to proceed after the 8th as information becomes available.

All building usage by any group will be discontinued through the month of April. This includes weddings, funerals, music rehearsals, outreach programs, etc. 

Starting today, we will begin having a weekly FaceBook live prayer time! Look for one of our smiling faces every Wednesday at 7pm. Make sure to like our church FaceBook page, First Baptist Church Muncie Indiana, to be able to watch and share any prayer requests or praises. 

Another way we connect with you is the monthly newsletter. For the month of April, we have decided to limit communication to digital only. We will make sure those without online access will receive paper copies. 

Also starting this week, our church Call Team will be calling every active church family to communicate important info, see how things are going and offer a time of prayer together. 

We have a new YouTube channel! Please [click here](http://YouTube.com/c/fbcmuncieorg) and SUBSCRIBE! This is where all church videos will go, including sermons, music, announcements, children and youth lessons, etc. 

Since all building usage has been suspended through April, we will not be hosting the Good Friday service. We will be in discussion about other options and report updates regarding this as they become available. 

As stated above, we have canceled all in person worship services through April. This includes Easter Sunday. We want you to know we're working very hard brainstorming ways to make this service as special as it can be. We will keep you updated!

While some of this could bring a sense of disappointment, I encourage you to keep a posture of hope and thanksgiving. I’m hopeful because I know God is still in control. And I’m thankful for the current “pause” to spend uninterrupted time with my family. We have so many resources that allow us to stay connected outside of the home as well. Be intentional with your time. Reach out to family/friends/neighbors. Pray daily, hourly even! Create healthy habits and share them with those around you. Whatever you can do to be the light. Remember, we are the Church, we’ve just “left the building”.

>“Each one of you is part of the body of Christ, and you were chosen to live together in peace. So let the peace that comes from Christ control your thoughts. And be grateful.” ‭‭Colossians‬ ‭3:15‬
