As we think back on this year, there have been many disappointments. I am sad that we will not be able to gather for our annual Harvest Dinner this year. As I began to think about Thanksgiving and the dynamics of expressing gratitude, it seemed like it might be a challenge this year. Yet the more I studied gratitude, the more convinced I became that we may need it more this year than in past years. The Scripture writers often admonish us toward thanksgiving and praise during seasons of difficulty. As we consider God's blessings, we are able to form a new perspective on the hardships we might be experiencing. 

With this being said, we are going to spend three weeks celebrating Thanksgiving. Sadly, we not be consuming turkey and dressing each Sunday. But we will explore the topic of gratitude and hear stories from those in congregation who have found good in the midst of difficulty.

This week, we will study Psalm 107:1-3, 17-22 together. I will include it below for you to read as you prepare for worship on Sunday.

> (Psalms 107:1-3 NIV)  Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; his love endures forever.  Let the redeemed of the Lord tell their story— those he redeemed from the hand of the foe,  those he gathered from the lands, from east and west, from north and south. 

> (Psalms 107:17-22 NIV)  Some became fools through their rebellious ways and suffered affliction because of their iniquities.  They loathed all food and drew near the gates of death.  Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble, and he saved them from their distress.  He sent out his word and healed them; he rescued them from the grave.  Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for mankind.  Let them sacrifice thank offerings and tell of his works with songs of joy.
