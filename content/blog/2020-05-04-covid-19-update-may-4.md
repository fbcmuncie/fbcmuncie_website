Church Family,

Most of you are probably aware of the updates the Governor made last Friday. While churches technically can resume in person services May 8th, we are encouraged to continue with our online services, and that is what we plan to do. Over the next week, Pastor Wade will attend a couple meetings that will be helpful in navigating how to safely reopen our building. One meeting is with our national denominational and state leaders, the other one is with Church Mutual, our insurance company. The CCT will be meeting May 12th and plans to spend majority of the meeting discussing our next steps. 

Please know we want everyone's safety to be a priority. Those in our congregation, groups that use our building weekly, all the way to those that come in for weddings and funerals. There is a lot of information and guidelines to unpack here! We will be sure to keep you all informed as soon as any new information or updates have been made.

As always, we appreciate your patience and support as we have worked our way through the last several weeks. I'm thrilled to see the light at the end of the tunnel now! We encourage you to continue showing up virtually and worshiping with us until we can safely meet in person again. 

Lastly, I have been thinking about everyone's individual journey through this. Some people had very insignificant changes, while others have lost loved ones. Some were out of work, while others worked selflessly to serve others. Weddings were canceled. Children adjusted to school at home. There's no hugging or girls night out or sports. There are lots and lots of realities out there, all different from each other. My hope is that as we near the end of this, that we are kinder, stronger, more faithful and full of hope as we look ahead to our own paths God has laid before us.

>Not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope -- Romans 5:3-4

Thank you,

Colleen Massoth
