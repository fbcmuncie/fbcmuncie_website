You'd Better Wake Up

There isn’t anything worse for a person than to be spiritually asleep. Spiritual sleep is a tragedy. You can be a very good person and still be asleep spiritually. Do you remember when Jesus agonized while the disciples slept? Every person has an opportunity to wake up and be engaged in the growth of the Kingdom.

Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour has come, and the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners. Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!”

Matthew 26:45-46, NIV

Wake up, Look Up, Speak Up, and Stand Up are four steps to being alert to the Spirit of Christ. Come and learn how to apply these principles to your daily experiences so you may be an effective servant of Christ.
