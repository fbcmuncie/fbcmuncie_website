Each week, I typically send out a few sentences and this week's passage for you to read ahead of time. I am going to ask a bit more of you this week. As you probably know by now, we will be holding our first in-person worship service this coming **Sunday, July 5** at **9:15 AM** in the circle drive (on the northwest side of the church). There is much information that I hope you will take the time to read.

## The Visitor

The [July Visitor](http://visitor.fbcmuncie.org/visitor_2020-07.pdf) is a special edition publication with all of the information that you will need to know. Please take the time to read through it. 

## Letter on Singing

In our research around the many aspects of coming back to in-person worship, we have been discussing the issues of singing together. Please take a few minutes to [read this letter](http://reports.fbcmuncie.org/singing_letter_2020.pdf).

## Videos

I know that many in our world today skim over written information. So we have developed a few videos to help.

## Philippians

Finally, as we come back together, we will be pausing our Sermon on the Mount series in order to study the book of Philippians together. Paul is writing to a suffering church. His words of hope and joy are pertinent in the stress filled world of 2020. Please take a few minutes to read over this week's passage. 

> (Philippians 1:1-11 NTE) From Paul and Timothy, slaves of King Jesus, to all God's holy ones in King Jesus who are in Philippi, together with the overseers and ministers:  grace to you and peace, from God our father and King Jesus the Lord. I thank my God every time I think of you!  I always pray with joy, whenever I pray for you all,  because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now.  Of this I'm convinced: the one who began a good work in you will thoroughly complete it by the day of King Jesus. It's right for me to think this way about all of you. You have me in your hearts, here in prison as I am, working to defend and bolster up the gospel. You are my partners in grace, all of you!  Yes: God can bear witness how much I'm longing for all of you with the deep love of King Jesus. And this is what I'm praying: that your love may overflow still more and more, in knowledge and in all astute wisdom.  Then you will be able to tell the difference between good and evil, and be sincere and faultless on the day of the Messiah,  filled to overflowing with the fruit of right living, fruit that comes through King Jesus to God's glory and praise.
