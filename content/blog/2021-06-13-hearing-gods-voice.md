Hearing God's Voice

Listening for God’s voice is an essential discipline for every Christian to practice. Do you know when God calls your name? Do you want to hear His Voice? Do you take time to allow God’s Spirit the opportunity to touch your life? We must understand the balance between worship and ministry.

Now there was a man in Caesarea named Cornelius, a centurion of what was called the Italian cohort, a devout man and one who feared God with all his household, and made many charitable contributions to the Jewish people and prayed to God continually. About the ninth hour of the day, he clearly saw in a vision an angel of God who had just come in and said to him, “Cornelius!” And he looked at him intently and became terrified, and said, “What is it, lord?” And he said to him, “Your prayers and charitable gifts have ascended as a memorial offering before God. Now dispatch some men to Joppa and send for a man named Simon, who is also called Peter; he is staying with a tanner named Simon, whose house is by the sea.” When the angel who spoke to him left, he summoned two of his servants and a devout soldier from his personal attendants, and after he had explained everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.

Acts 10:1-8, NASB

What is more important? To worship or to answer the needs of those around us who are in need. There has always been a struggle between worship, meditation, prayer, praise, thanksgiving, etc. What do we do? Come and discover how to meet God and answer His call upon your life.
