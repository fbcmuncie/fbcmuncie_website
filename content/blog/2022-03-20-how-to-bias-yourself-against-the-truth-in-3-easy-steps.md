How to Bias Yourself Against the Truth in 3 Easy Steps | Mark 6

Do you think you're open-minded? A lot of folks in Jesus's day probably thought they could recognize the truth when they encountered it, but Mark 6 shows us several ways people shut down the reality of God's truth instead of letting it change their perspectives. We'll be taking an "aerial look" at several of these stories---and a famous children's book as well---so we can recognize ways that we tend to bias ourselves against the truth rather than letting it challenge us.

Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to his disciples to distribute to the people. He also divided the two fish among them all. They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish. The number of the men who had eaten was five thousand.

Mark 6:41-44, NIV

Join us Sunday as we decide together to embrace God's truth---no matter where it leads!
