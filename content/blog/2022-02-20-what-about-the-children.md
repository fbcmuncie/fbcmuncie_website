What About the Children | II Samuel 18:28-34

 

Life is a challenge and there is nothing more challenging than seeking to bring children to a knowledge of Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord. David had some lessons he knew and others he learned that can assist the Church in fulfilling its desire to minister to children. Developing respect and trust and creating a kind of atmosphere where there can be laughter, humanity, hopes, and dreams makes a difference.

“‘Listen, Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength. These words that I am giving you today are to be in your heart. Repeat them to your children. Talk about them when you sit in your house and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up. Bind them as a sign on your hand and let them be a symbol on your forehead. Write them on the doorposts of your house and on your city gates.’”

-Deuteronomy 6:4-9, CSB

What is your commitment to children’s ministry? Even though you may not have children around you often, what can you contribute to the church to make children a priority?
