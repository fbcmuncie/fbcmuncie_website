Mother's Day Hope | 1 Peter 1:3

The Bible is filled with HOPE, and if you wanted a one-word definition of the heart of the Christian faith, this word-H.O.P.E.- would be it. On this Mother’s Day, it is “hoped” that you will be present in worship as we examine the Scriptures and see how the early Church practiced this characteristic of faith.
“Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! In his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,”

1 Peter 1:3, NIV

The disciples look around as Jesus talked about the power and might of God. However, they sometimes wondered if this was true. Jesus taught His disciples, and ultimately us, how to find hope for our families, our faith, and our future. I look forward to seeing you present as we celebrate the blessing of HOPE in 2022.
