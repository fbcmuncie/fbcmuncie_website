As we move toward the end of our study in Philippians (2 more weeks), we come to one of my favorite verses this week. No doubt, 2020 has been a difficult year for most of us. In light of this, Philippians 4:4-9 becomes extremely pertinent to our lives. 

Let me encourage you to read these verses and perhaps even commit them to memory. We will find them extremely helpful as we navigate our trying times. I will include them below in both the NIV (New International Version) and the NTE (New Testament for Everyone) versions.

> (Philippians 4:4-9 NIV)  Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice!  Let your gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near.  Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.  And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.  Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things.  Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me—put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you. 


> (Philippians 4:4-9 NTE)  Celebrate joyfully in the Lord, all the time. I'll say it again: celebrate!   Let everybody know how gentle and gracious you are. The Lord is near.  Don't worry about anything. Rather, in every area of life let God know what you want, as you pray and make requests, and give thanks as well.   And God's peace, which is greater than we can ever understand, will keep guard over your hearts and minds in King Jesus.  For the rest, my dear family, these are the things you should think through: whatever is true, whatever is holy, whatever is upright, whatever is pure, whatever is attractive, whatever has a good reputation; anything virtuous, anything praiseworthy.   And these are the things you should do: what you learned, received, heard and saw in and through me. And the God of peace will be with you.
