Be Careful

“Blessing our Children” is the major focus of our attention this Sunday as we celebrate High Attendance Day in worship at FBC Muncie. Our children point us to our church’s future, and we must “be careful” how we model our faith so others will be able to learn, grow, and thrive in the ways of Christ. 

No one lights a lamp and hides it in a clay jar or puts it under a bed. Instead, they put it on a stand, so that those who come in can see the light. For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out into the open. Therefore consider carefully how you listen. Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what they think they have will be taken from them.

Luke 8:16-18, NIV

The blessing of commitment, trust, and obedience to Christ lend themselves to Christian growth and development. Join the entire church family this Sunday as we commit ourselves anew to the blessing of nurturing children through faith in Jesus Christ.
