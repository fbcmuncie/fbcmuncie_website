God in Human Shoes | Romans 6:1-11

God coming into the world makes a difference. Jesus said, “Whoever has seen me has seen the Father.” If you want to know what God is like, look at Jesus Christ, and know that whatever Jesus did, that is what God did.

Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. For if we have been united together in the likeness of His death, certainly we also shall be in the likeness of His resurrection, knowing this, that our old man was crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves of sin.

Romans 6:4-6, NKJV

God sent Jesus to help us celebrate Christmas with new life, new peace, new joy, and new love. Let us claim His presence in our lives as we worship and remember the truths of the Gospel.
