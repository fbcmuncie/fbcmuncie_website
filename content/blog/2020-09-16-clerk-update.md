Greetings,

As time goes on and things have settled down a bit, we find not much changing in the way of Sunday mornings at FBC. With that said, everything we are doing now will remain in effect until the end of the year. We will of course let you know if that changes! Since there really aren’t weekly updates to report, this will be my last weekly reminder until there’s a change in schedule. I encourage you to save this email or bookmark the YouTube link if you are still watching from home so it’s easily accessible to you on Sunday mornings.

Here’s the link below for the live virtual service, streaming at 10:45 AM. [https://www.youtube.com/c/fbcmuncieorg](https://www.youtube.com/c/fbcmuncieorg) 

## In Person Check In

If you were at church last week, you noticed our greeters getting you checked in on iPads. We are asking everyone, adults and kids alike, to check in. Please begin to make this a habit! This is important for many reasons, but currently it will help us track attendance and be able to do any contact tracing it that’s ever necessary. All the info is stored in our database and can be accessed with the click of a button! (You must enter through the main sanctuary doors or the elevator entrance. All other doors will be locked.)

There are two ways to check in: 

1. enter the last 4-digits of your phone number 
2. or enter your last name. 

Don’t worry though, there will be someone there to help you until we all get acclimated! 

## Volunteers 

If you are serving somewhere on Sunday morning (nursery, worship, sound, etc) please stop by the check in station before heading to your scheduled post. We want to be as accurate as possible with our attendance. 

## Children’s Ministry

We opened up our child care and children’s classrooms last Sunday! While attendance in the rooms is still low, things went well :)  Below is our list of safety precautions and guidelines for dropping off your little ones. 

- There are sanitizing stations and children’s masks outside of each classroom.
- Be sure to have your child/ren's name tag on before dropping him/her off, as this is a requirement.
- If you are leaving your child/ren in the Infant/Ones room or with Dave and Joyce, please wait in the hall and maintain physical distance as each family drops off their child/ren. 
- There’s a slight change for the K-5th graders. All K-5th will meet downstairs in the lower auditorium before the service begins. The mentees will have everything they need to provide the lessons in this space. 

If you haven’t yet please click this link and read the Welcome Back Newsletter from Britney! It has all the new guidelines and can tell you what to expect on Sunday mornings.

Here’s a final recap of our Sunday morning:

- We will continue to meet at our combined service time of 10:45 AM.
- Self screen for any COVID symptoms. Please stay home if you’re not feeling well.
- Children over 8 and adults are required to wear a mask (children 3-8 yrs old are strongly encouraged to wear a mask)
- Everyone needs to check in with a greeter
- Drop children off in age appropriate room before the service begins
- Remember to physically distance (leave 1 or 2 pews in between non family members)
- The balcony is open for seating
- Bring your own bible
- Please exit promptly when the service is over and limit fellowship to outside


We look forward to seeing you this Sunday!

In Him,

Colleen
