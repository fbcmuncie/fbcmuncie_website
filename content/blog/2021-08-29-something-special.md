Something Special

The healing stories of Jesus are stories we all need to hear. How do we choose to deal with such honest questions about healing, hope, and faith? The answers we come up with are significant, and they affect us on a daily basis.

When Jesus came down from the mountainside, large crowds followed him. A man with leprosy came and knelt before him and said, “Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.”

Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. “I am willing,” he said. “Be clean!” Immediately he was cleansed of his leprosy.

-Matthew 8:1-3, NIV

We have choices to make. F.G. Sampson once said: “In a life of purpose, one can’t be satisfied until one gives what he is. When one comes face to face with God and with his sense of being, and one stands there with God, one cannot find peace of soul until one has followed the path of God rather than the path of men.” Come and worship, and allow God to love you to the depths and heights and breadths and lengths of life.
