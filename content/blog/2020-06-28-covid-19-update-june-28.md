Greetings,



As I write this, we are exactly one week away from our first in person worship service since March. While things will most definitely look different, it is another step towards getting back to some normalcy and routine on Sunday mornings :)


In this letter I want to lay out our church’s plan for coming back in July. Please know the CCT has had hours of zoom meetings and spent even more time researching and trying to find what our best practices should be. This has been difficult and stressful, as you can imagine! We had another meeting on June 23 and we feel we have come up with a safe way for us to gather together again.


Read below for our plan to reunite in person:


## When and where will we meet?


We will meet outside on the west side of the church (circle drive) at **9:15 AM every Sunday in July**. Please enter the worship space through the Jefferson St opening. The service will be 45 minutes or less in duration.

\*Please bring your own chair, bible and beverages. Water fountains will not be available.

## What if I’m not ready to come back?

You can join us virtually! We will continue to live stream each week for the foreseeable future. \*Please note that starting July 5th, the **live stream will begin at 9:15 AM**.

Watch on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/fbcmuncieorg) or on the [FBC website](https://fbcmuncie.org)

## Where do I park?

As always there will be parking available on the street (both Adams and Jefferson) And of course you may still park in the church parking lot. In addition, there will be 4 parking spots labeled handicapped in the Northwest Bank parking lot.

## Can I bring my children?

Yes, children are welcome! However, there will be no childcare or children’s classes at this time.

## When will child care and children’s classes resume?

While we are unable to provide specifics, we are hoping to phase these
ministries back into the life of the church in time. If you are a volunteer in children
or youth ministries, please let your ministry leader know if you are willing to continue in
your role when these ministries resume.

## Are there any new rules or requirements?

- Yes. We ask that you please maintain social distancing (6 feet apart) throughout the duration of the service. Please respect others’ level of caution and refrain from hugging and handshaking.
- Masks are highly recommended (except for children under 2 and those who have conditions that restrict breathing).
- Sanitation stations will be provided upon entry and exit. 
- Self screening before church is recommended. If you aren’t feeling well, please stay home. 
- As I stated earlier, you may want to bring your own bible. There will be no bibles, hymnals, bulletins or handouts of any kind. 

## Where do I put my offering?

There will be a "dropbox" available for tithing. We will not pass the offering plate. 

## Will we do communion?

While we usually do communion on the first Sunday of the month, we are choosing to postpone communion until July 12th. We will have "touchless" communion available on the 12th for those coming in person.

## Will restrooms be available?

While we ask you to limit traffic in and out of the building, there will be 2 handicapped accessible bathrooms open during the service. These bathrooms will also have changing tables. 


## What if there’s inclement weather?

If inclement weather prevents us from holding an outside service, we will notify the congregation of the cancellation through email/website two hours before the service. If we make this decision ahead of time, a live stream will be provided for you to watch at home at 9:15 AM. In the event of a last-minute or during-service storm, we will dismiss everyone and post resources (online sermon, music) for later viewing.


I think by now a lot of us have seen similar recommendations and guidelines around town. I can’t deny that this seems strange, to be having to prepare to go back to church in this way. We may feel out of sorts at first. We all may not agree on our rules/recommendations. All this change can be very frustrating and overwhelming. But please remember that we are learning more and more about the Coronavirus everyday. We are developing treatments and vaccines. Being cautious now allows for continued progress. These conditions are temporary. So let’s all do our part now, so down the road, we are where we want to be.


> For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.

Joyfully His,
