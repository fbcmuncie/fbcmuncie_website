Surviving in the Wilderness

The wilderness is a hard place to be; trackless and harsh. 
There are many voices in the wilderness.
The beginning of the good news about Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God, as it is written in Isaiah the prophet:

“I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way”—
“a voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.’”

And so John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.

-Mark 1:1-5, NIV
Repentance asks, “How am I going to live in the wilderness? What does God want me to do?”

Come and hear God’s Voice to you in the wilderness…
