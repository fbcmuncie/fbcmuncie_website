Thank you to [Caleb Rolling](https://fbcmuncie.org/caleb-rolling/) for preaching on Sunday. I appreciate Caleb's thoughtful and in-depth exploration of the Lord's prayer. If you were not able to be present (virtually or in person) on Sunday, you can find the [sermon here](https://fbcmuncie.org/video/2020/10/04/the-lords-prayer/). 

[This week](https://fbcmuncie.org/worship/2020-10-11-fasting-101/), we continue to discuss motivations in our *righteous acts* or *spiritual works*. [A couple of weeks ago](https://fbcmuncie.org/video/2020/09/27/the-secret-place/), we discussed the giving and prayer. This week, we will talk about fasting. Let me encourage you to take a few minutes to read this passage before we gather for worship on Sunday.

> (Matthew 6:16-18 NTE)  When you fast, don't be gloomy like the play-actors. They make their faces quite unrecognizable, so that everyone can see they're fasting. I'm telling you the truth: they have received their reward in full.   No: when you fast, tidy your hair and beard the way you normally do, and wash your face,   so that others won't notice you're fasting – except your father, privately. Then your father, who sees in private, will repay you.
