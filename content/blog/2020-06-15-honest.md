As we continue our series on the Sermon on the Mount, we also celebrate Father's Day. This week's passage deals with an ever important topic in today's culture. We live in a world of spam emails, advertisements that stretch the truth, and telemarketers with false identity claims. It is difficult to find an honest person in the mix. 

Let me encourage you to take a few minutes to read this week's passage as you prepare for worship. I will include it below in the NTE version.

>(Matthew 5:33-37 NTE) "Again, you heard that it was said to the people long ago: 'You shall not swear falsely, but you shall give to the Lord what you promised under oath.'  But I say to you: don't swear at all! Don't swear by heaven (it's God's throne!);  don't swear by the earth (it's God's footstool!); don't swear by Jerusalem (it's the city of the great king!);  don't swear by your head (you can't make one hair of it turn white or black!).  When you're, talking, say 'Yes' when you mean Yes, and 'No' when you mean No. Anything more than that comes from the evil one."
