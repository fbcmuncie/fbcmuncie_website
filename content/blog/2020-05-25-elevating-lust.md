This week we come to our sixth week of our Sermon on the Mount series. Let me warn you, the passages do not get easier. In fact, they get more and more difficult. We talked this past week about Jesus redefining murder as including the anger that fuels it. This week, we find Jesus elevating lust to the level of adultery. In the same way, Jesus is concerned about what is going on in our hearts. 

Let me encourage you to read the passage as you prepare for worship on Sunday. We continue to meet at 10:45 AM via live stream. I hope you can join us.

Here is this week's passage from the New Testament for Everyone translation.


>(Matthew 5:27-30 NTE) "You heard", Jesus continued, "that it was said, “You shall not commit adultery.”  But I say to you: everyone who gazes at a woman in order to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.  If your right eye trips you up, tear it out and throw it away. Yes: it's better for you to have one part of your body destroyed than for the whole body to be thrown into Gehenna.  And if your right hand trips you up, cut it off and throw it away. Yes: it's better for you to have one part of your body destroyed than for your whole body to go into Gehenna.
