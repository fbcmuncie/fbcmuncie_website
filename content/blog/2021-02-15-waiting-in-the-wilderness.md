The Lenten season is a time of repentance, fasting, and reflection as we draw closer to God. We take this time to reflect on the journey of Christ from the start of his ministry, to the calling of the disciples, to miracles he performed, to the teachings he imparted, and to his eventual journey to the cross. It is often the case that we are eager to rush during Lent, to Holy Week, the Cross, and his resurrection; however, Jesus began his ministry with a period of time in the wilderness.  This week we will examine Matthew 4:1-11 as we discuss Jesus' time in the wilderness waiting. During this Lenten season and during our own church's interim period, we too will be intentional in our journey as we wait in the wilderness.
