What About the Thorn | II Corinthians 12:7-10


Sometimes our prayer experiences are perplexing and frustrating. What do you do when nothing seems to happen?  Jesus said, “Ask and it will be given you unto; seek and you will find; knock and it will be opened to you,” (Matthew 7:7). This is a direct statement and promise. What is God saying if the answers do not come quickly?

But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me.

II Corinthians 12:9, NIV

Come and learn how to deal with delayed responses, unknown answers, and uncertain futures? God is still there in all your circumstances.
