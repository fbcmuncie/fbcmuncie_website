Father's Day Love

Father’s Day 2021 is a great day to examine your level of unconditional love, which is what Jesus gave to us. So, how do we model that love toward others? Our families, our friends, our children, our loved ones notice whether we LOVE or NOT! Love is described in these verses so that there is no doubt about what Christ expects…patient, kind, not arrogant, or rude.

Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.

-1 Corinthians 13:4-8, NIV

Is radical love realistic for your heart and mind to comprehend? Come and be challenged to adopt Christ’s definition of love into your life!
