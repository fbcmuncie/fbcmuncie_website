As we move into the season of Epiphany, Lent, and Easter, we will be working our way through John's Gospel. We usually spend these seasons in the Gospels (Matthew in 2020, Mark in 2018, Luke in 2016). We have not spent extended time in John. We will not have time to cover every verse. So let me encourage you to begin reading the Gospel of John now. You will find reading the entire Gospel helpful as we move quickly from chapter to chapter. I am looking forward to studying this book with you in 2021. Here are the scheduled January passages.






- January 03 - Belief and Life (John 20:30–31) 
- January 10 - Jesus's Baptism (John 1:1–18) 
- January 17 - The First Miracle (John 2:1–11) 
- January 24 - New Birth (John 3:1–8) 
- January 31 - More Signs (John 5:1–18)
