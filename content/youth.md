## Youth Ministry Mission Statement

In partnership with families, the youth ministry of FBC exists to engage 100% of the students under its care, to train them to live independently in Christ, and to send them out as exceptional, godly men and women of integrity who will transform their homes, their schools, their churches, their workplaces, and their worlds for Christ.

## Youth Schedule

The youth ministry schedule varies from week to week. You can refer back to this page to see what is coming up.

**Sunday school** every Sunday, 9:30-10:15am in the FBC Youth Room (second floor).

**Zoom Youth Bible Study** every Sunday 4:30-5:30pm.
- (Contact Deena Green for the Zoom link)

Allowing the youth time to serve throughout the church and gather in homes facilitates a strong connection with the wider church body. Serving allowing the youth to connect in ways that will keep them involved as they get older. It also helps them understand Jesus' posture of submission and humility.

As the youth gather in homes, they are able to get to know adults and each other in a more casual setting. Sharing a meal together also models Jesus' example of eating with others.

Here is the schedule for the next few weeks.

The youth will be meeting via Zoom each week at 10 AM. Deena is sending out invites to the Zoom meeting each week.
