Emily Anderson is the Worship Coordinator at First Baptist.  She is employed with the Delaware County Circuit Court as their Court Administrator.  She has been a member of the church since 2008, and enjoys being an active part of our church family.  Recently you’ve seen Emily singing on the praise team and with the choir, running the sound board, and assisting with filling and distributing baskets to shut-ins at Thanksgiving.  Emily is married to Coby, and they have two daughters, two granddaughters, and a grandson. When she isn’t busy at work or church you’ll find her singing, reading, and spending time with friends and family.
