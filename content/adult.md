Adult Ministries provides opportunities in addition to Sunday School to be involved in the life of the church.  Serving in childrenâ€™s and youth ministry leadership roles, helping with church activities such as the Harvest Dinner meal, or signing up to help with adult activities ranging from the Senior Adult Day activities to volunteering in the church office are among the many opportunities to participate.  Because the church has two worship services, there is an intentional ongoing activity to help everyone be better acquainted.  The Church Friends Lunch, offered three times per year, brings people from the church family together to share lunch at the church or a restaurant and provides brief mixer activities to help everyone get to know others.  Finally, a strongly meaningful activity for Adult Ministries is participation in a Life Group, a small group focus on Bible study, discussion, and relationship-building.  These groups meet two times per month and offer opportunities to grow in faith and become richly aligned with other Christians in the church.
