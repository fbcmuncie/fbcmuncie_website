# Overview of Children's Ministry

The Children’s Ministry at FBC Muncie is led by a team of dedicated individuals who dearly love the youngest members of the church. At FBC Muncie, we believe that Children’s Ministry should be:

-   **Holistic and safe.** We care for the spiritual, emotional, social, and physical needs of children from infancy through 5th grade. To create a safe environment for our children, FBC Muncie requires that all Children’s Ministry volunteers be background checked and children can only be picked up by a parent / guardian with a matching security tag. For more information on FBC Muncie’s Child Protection Policy or the pick-up/drop-off safety procedures, go to the “Frequently Asked Questions” section below.  

-  **Age-appropriate**.
 FBC Muncie has three classroom experiences, each designed with the specific age and developmental stages of children in mind. While in their classrooms, you can expect your children to learn biblical teachings through play areas with age-appropriate toys, group activities, books, and crafts.

 -  **Part of the life of the entire congregation.**
 FBC Muncie believes that God created the church to be intergenerational. Children bring new gifts, energy, and perspectives that encourage the adults, while adults model for children what it looks like to worship and live out the Christian faith. For these reasons, FBC Muncie is committed to creating regular opportunities for children to be involved in worship and community service alongside the adult members of the congregation.

Below you'll find more about what you can expect from FBC Muncie’s Children’s Ministry.

## Sunday School - Sundays at 9:30 a.m.

“Sunday School” refers to a time of small group Bible lessons during the hour before our regular worship service. FBC Muncie has Sunday School classes for all ages. Sunday School starts at 9:30am, but our Children’s Ministry volunteers will be ready and available for you to drop-off your children starting at 9:15am.

- **Nursery** *(Rm. 105)* is available for infants through 3 year olds.
- **Preschool** *(Rm. 102)* is available for preschoolers ages 4 and 5.
- **1st-5th Grade** *(Rm. B01)* is available for children in 1st-5th grade.

Following Sunday School, parents with young children in the Nursery are invited to leave their children in their classroom and head straight to the sanctuary for worship.

Parents of older children preschool through 5th grade will pick-up their children from their Sunday School classes (around 10:30-10:40am) and take them to the sanctuary with you for the first part of worship before being dismissed to Children’s Church.


## Worship and Children’s Church - Sundays at 10:45am

FBC Muncie provides childcare throughout all of worship for infants through 3 year olds in the Nursery (Rm. 105).

Because FBC Muncie believes that Children’s Ministry should be part of the life of the entire congregation, we welcome preschool through 5th grade children to participate in the first half of Sunday worship with the adults.

During this time, children will be invited to join their families and the congregation in:

- singing, clapping, and dancing to praise songs
- reading and listening to holy Scripture
- praying
- participating in occasional “Children’s Time,” activities and lessons at the front of the sanctuary.

When the first half of worship is over, a member of the FBC Muncie Leadership Team will invite all the children to line up and follow our Children’s Ministry volunteers to Children’s Church. Preschool children (ages 4-5) will have Children’s Church in Rm. 102 and children 1st-5th grade will have Children’s Church in Rm. B01. You are also welcome to walk with your child to Children’s Church if that makes you or your child feel more comfortable.

During this second half of worship, adults will have the opportunity to hear the sermon and call of response without worrying about entertaining their children. Meanwhile, during Children’s Church, your kids will be engaging with the Bible story through short stories, crafts, games, and other age-appropriate group activities.

When worship is over, parents will take their security tag to pick-up their children from their various classrooms. If you are unsure where a classroom is located, you can stop by the Welcome Center and someone there will be able to guide you.


## Special Events - Dates and Times Vary

Several children’s events are planned throughout the year. Some are just for fun while others are ways for the children to serve in the church or community. Events are age appropriate and fun for the whole family!

- Camp Tippecanoe
- Vacation Bible School (VBS)
- Kids Day out
- Family Service opportunities
- Operation Christmas Child

# Frequently Asked Questions

{{< faq "What security measures are in place?" "We have a check in station for children at our Welcome Center, located on the first floor hallway just outside the sanctuary. At the welcome center, our greeters will be able to assist you with checking-in your children and getting them to the correct classrooms.  

When checking-in, parents enter a phone number and a name tag is issued for each child in that family. On the name tag is the child’s name, age, parent’s phone number (that is how you will be notified if your child is sick, hurt, etc), any known allergies, and a random code. Parents will get a security tag with a code that matches their child’s; this tag will need to be presented for pick up. Each classroom maintains at least two adults at all times. All Children's ministry volunteers are background checked and trained by an FBC Leader.">}}

{{< faq "Can I volunteer on the Children’s Ministry team or in a classroom?" "We are always looking for those who have a heart to love and teach our children, but also would like to build a relationship and make expectations and resources available to those who volunteer. Backgroud checks and training are required for all volunteers. You can contact the church office, the Children's Ministry CCT Leader, or our pastors for more information." >}}

{{< faq "Can children bring an offering?" "Absolutely! We encourage it! There are containers in each classroom in which the children can place their offering." >}}

{{< faq "Does my child need to bring a Bible?" "No. But they are welcome to if they have their own. In Sunday School and Children’s Church the kids will be looking over passages in the Bible. We will certainly provide a Bible if your child does not have one." >}}
