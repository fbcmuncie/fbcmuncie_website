# Overview of Children's Ministry

The Children’s Ministry at FBC is led by a team of dedicated individuals who dearly love the youngest members of the church body. This group addresses the spiritual, emotional, and physical needs of children from infancy through 5th grade through biblical teaching, play areas with appropriate toys, aesthetically pleasing rooms, and caring, competent teens and adults from the church who have passed background checks. 

## Nursery Room 105

 The Nursery and Toddler rooms are available during both services (9:15 AM and 10:45 AM).  Infants are cared for in our clean and quiet nursery. Infants through 2-year-olds will be getting to practice sharing, helping, and playing together. We ask you to give detailed instructions on what your baby/toddler will need while you are away. We want to keep every child on his/her normal routine as much as possible.

## Toddler Room 106

The 2 and 3-year-olds will have time for play, as well as hear a new Bible story each week. They get to listen to music, make a craft, and enjoy a snack/drink. Please inform our volunteers of any allergies. This room is equipped with a child sized restroom, for those children who may be potty training.

## Preschool Room 102

Our Preschool room is for ages 4-5 yrs old (children must be potty trained).  This class is offered during our first and second services (9:15 AM and 10:45 AM).  Weekly lessons focus on teaching children about knowing and loving Jesus through hands on activities, crafts, and age appropriate videos.  This room also has accessibility to a child sized restroom.

## Sunday School: K-2nd Room B01 / 3rd-5th Room B06

Sunday School is held during the first service (9:15am) for children ages K-5th. Children are divided by grade and have age appropriate lessons. Parents pick up their children following the service.

Children will get to hear a new lesson each week, have opportunities to serve in the church and community, and enjoy fellowship time with each other. We will encourage the children to read from the Bible, pray with friends, play games, be kind to others, and love and trust in the Lord.


## Children's Church

Children’s church is available for children in grades K-2nd and 3rd-5th during the second service (10:45AM). The children will go to church with their parents until the songs of worship are finished. The pastor will dismiss the children and an adult will be up front to escort the children to their proper rooms. They will have a Bible lesson each week. Depending on the lesson, they may play a game, make a craft, watch a short story, or do other activities related to the lesson. We teach the children about how to be a part of the church and that they are all important in the eyes of Jesus. Parents pick up their children following the service.

## Special Events

Several children’s events are planned throughout the year. Some are just for fun while others are ways for the children to serve in the church or community. Events are age appropriate and fun for the whole family!

## Communication: Be In The Know!

We communicate through email, newsletters, the church bulletin, and Sunday morning announcements to inform families of upcoming events. We also have a Facebook page (FBC Muncie Children’s Events) where we post event details and photos of recent children’s events. Of course, if you miss any important info, contact our Children’s Ministry Coordinator with any questions.

## Tippecanoe Camp and Retreat

Camp Tippy is located in the northeastern part of Indiana. Children and teens (K-12th grade) from FBC Muncie have been attending this camp for decades! If your child is interested in attending, check out [Camp Tippy](https://sites.google.com/site/camptippecanoe/home)  for their summer schedule and pricing.

# Frequently Asked Questions

{{< faq "What security measures are in place?" "We have a check in station for children at our Welcome Center. Parents enter a phone number and a name tag is issued for each child in that family. On the name tag is the child’s name, age, parent’s phone number (that is how you will be notified if your child is sick, hurt, etc), any known allergies, and a random alphanumeric code. Parents will get a security tag with a code that matches their child’s; this tag will need to be presented for pick up.">}}

{{< faq "Can I volunteer on the Children’s Ministry team or in a classroom?" "Yes! We are always looking for those who have a heart to love and teach our children. You can contact Britney Sue or Colleen Massoth for more info." >}}

{{< faq "Can children bring an offering?" "Absolutely! We encourage it! There are containers in each classroom in which the children can place their offering." >}}

{{< faq "Does my child need to bring a Bible?" "No. But they are welcome to if they have their own. In Sunday School and Children’s Church the kids will be looking over passages in the Bible. We will certainly provide a Bible if your child does not have one." >}}
