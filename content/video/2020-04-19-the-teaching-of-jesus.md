As we prepare for our study on the Sermon on the Mount, we explore how to read this ever important section of Matthew's gospel. Too often, we attempt to redefine Jesus' words in light of the ethical systems of our day. Instead, we need to understand Jesus as the authoritative Messiah who is forming a people to fulfill the mission of God in the world.
