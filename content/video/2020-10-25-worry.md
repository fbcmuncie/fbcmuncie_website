Jesus uses tangible, visible illustrations to remind us of God's provision in our lives. The birds of the air and the plants in the fields (flowers and grass) have all they need.

Jesus instructs us to relinquish our worry and place our faith in God's supplying our essential needs, focusing our energy instead on the Kingdom of God.
