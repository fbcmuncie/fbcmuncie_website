As we flip over to chapter 4 in our Philippians study, Paul addresses the church with deep affection. He then calls out two women who seem to be in conflict with one another. Paul realizes how quickly a church family can be divided and destroyed. We can learn much from these words as we consider how we function at First Baptist Church Muncie.
