This has not been an easy year. With the COVID-19 Pandemic, the economic implications of the pandemic, along with the recent events surrounding the tragic death of George Floyd, our world seems out of control. At the same time, voices from all directions are speaking. How do we know who is telling the truth and who is twisting the narrative for their own purposes. How do we respond to all that we are seeing and hearing as followers of Jesus? James gives us insight into these issues.
