Paul calls out the methods of false teachers, highlights his resume in light of their tactics, but quickly crumbles it up and throws it away. He then calls the church at Philippi to take a different approach, one of knowing Jesus. Knowing Jesus involves giving up, laying down, joining Him in his sufferings. But in doing this, we will also be able to participate in His resurrection.
