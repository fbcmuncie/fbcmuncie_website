In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus forbids his followers from swearing. In the Kingdom of God, we are called to live lives of raw honesty in the light of world that devalues commitments. We should not escalate our words in order to heighten our level of honesty. We should live lives of simple honesty in all we say and do.
