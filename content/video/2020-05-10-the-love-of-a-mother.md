On Mother's Day, we take a break from the Sermon on the Mount series to travel a bit further back in time. We reflect on the story of Samuel's mother, Hannah. As a barren woman she was grief stricken. God comes to her in her brokenness and provides a child. Through this story, we learn much about what it means to be a mother. At the same time, we also learn what it means to bring our heartache to God.
