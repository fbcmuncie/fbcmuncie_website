In Matthew 5:17-20, Jesus warns against throwing out the Old Testament in light of his life and ministry. Rather, Jesus explains his fulfillment of the Old Testament. As we read all of God's story, from Genesis to Revelation, through the lens of Jesus, we discover how Jesus completes what God plan to restore his creation.
