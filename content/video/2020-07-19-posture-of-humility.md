Paul turns from a discussion about his imprisonment to instruction to the church at Philippi. He prompts them to reflect on the ways in which they have benefited from Christ and encourages them to model the posture of Christ. He bids them to relinquish selfish ambition and vanity in order to take on humility and an others first mindset. In doing this, the church will complete Paul's joy.
