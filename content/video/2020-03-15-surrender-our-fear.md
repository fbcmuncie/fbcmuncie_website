In this video podcast, our pastor addresses the congregation at First Baptist Church in Muncie in the wake of the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic. As we explore the Bible's teaching around fear, anxiety, and peace, we remember God's instruction to trust and rely on Him alone. We often see how fear and faith live in contrast to one another. May God provide all that we need and guide us in this season of uncertainty.
