The final verses in Philippians 2 (19-30) could be seen as minor instructions pertaining to Paul's companions. They give an indication of how Paul plans to send these fellow servants back to Philippi. But as we dig a bit deeper, we discover powerful descriptions that point us toward faithful service to Christ. These verses help us examine how we might serve God in the same sort of way.
