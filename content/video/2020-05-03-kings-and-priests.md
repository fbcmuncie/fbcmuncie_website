The familiar passage about salt and light is often simplified into Jesus' followers serving as moral influencers in our broken world. Yet the story of God provides a greater calling for us. We are created by God in His image and called to be a kingdom of priests in our world. As we explore several passages throughout God's story, we can read Matthew 5:13-16 as call to live out this grand purpose in the places where God has placed us.
