From John 5-10, Jesus continues to explain, clarify, and prove his identity as the Son of God, the Messiah. All the while, the religious leaders seek to silence Him. As we consider the healing at the pool of Bethesda in John 5, we are challenged to place our faith in Jesus, trusting Him to restore us physically, emotionally, and spiritually.
