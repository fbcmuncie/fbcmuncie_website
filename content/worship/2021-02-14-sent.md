In Pastor Wade's final sermon as pastor at First Baptist Church, he explores the sabbatical passage from 2017, Luke 10:1-20. In this passage, Luke describes Jesus sending out seventy-two disciples on mission. As follower of Jesus, we can learn much from this text. Might we be faithful to follow Him where he leads.
