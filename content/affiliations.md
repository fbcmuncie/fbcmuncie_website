We are affiliated with the American Baptist Churches/USA and the American Baptist Churches of Indiana and Kentucky.

American Baptists are a Christ-centered, biblically grounded, ethnically diverse people called to radical personal discipleship in Christ Jesus. Our commitment to Jesus propels us to nurture authentic relationships with one another; build healthy churches; transform our communities, our nations, and our world; engage every member in hands-on ministry; and speak the prophetic word in love.

First Baptist is open to people with backgrounds from all denominations. We are a Bible-based congregation that welcomes those from various Christian backgrounds. We are a theologically diverse congregation, but all submit to the authority of Scripture in our lives.
